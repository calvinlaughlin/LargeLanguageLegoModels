This step in the instructions focuses on adding these two wedge plates to form a more detailed upper structure. This is a simple yet essential step to build up additional layers to the Lego model.

This LEGO instruction image lays out Step 16 of the build process. Here's a detailed description:

### Pieces Needed:
1. **Two grey cylindrical pieces** (Lego ID: 62462, officially called "Cross Axle 5M with End Stop")
    - These are light grey cylindrical pieces, each about 5 units (studs) long.
2. **Two translucent green round studs** (Lego ID: 58176, officially called "Round Tile 1x1 No. 1 with Solid Stud")
    - These are small, translucent green round tiles, 1x1 stud each.

### Assembly Process:

1. **Prepare Two Assemblies**:
   - Insert each translucent green round stud into the hole at one end of the grey cylindrical piece. Do this for both sets of pieces, so you end up with two light grey cylindrical pieces, each with a green stud attached at one end.

2. **Incorporate Assemblies into the Existing Structure**:
   - The existing structure is a complex assembly with mostly grey and white pieces. It has two red 2x4 plates prominently visible on the top.
   - Identify two cylindrical holes open on either side of this structure. The grey cylinders should be inserted into these holes so that the green stud end goes in first. The grey part should remain sticking out from the sides of the model as shown in the image.

### Contextual Placement:
   - The new assemblies are asymmetrically placed on either side of what appears to be a vehicle or robot's main body.
   - Ensure that the canons face outward, sticking perpendicular from the side of the body to maintain balance and symmetry.

### Safety Warning:
   - The warning indicates that these newly added pieces can be easily detached and could pose a choking hazard. Care should be taken not to aim or shoot these pieces at anyone, particularly not near faces.

This step adds additional propulsion or weapon details to the model, giving it a more intricate and functional appearance.

In this image, LEGO building step number 17 is depicted. Here, I'll describe the necessary pieces and their placements in detail:

### Step 17 Instructions for Someone Who is Blind:

1. **Identify the Pieces Needed:**
   - **Piece:** Two 1x2 white brackets (LEGO Part ID 2436b)

   - **Positioning:**
     - Place each bracket so that the flat side with one open stud is facing upwards.
     - The brackets should be positioned towards the front of the model in relation to the central part of the existing structure. Notice the main body of the model where two grey cylinder shapes and two green semi-opaque round tiles exist.

3. **Detailed Placement Context:**
   - These brackets will be placed on either side of the structure:
       - Align the first white 1x2 bracket on the left side of the model. Position it directly next to the grey cylindrical part, ensuring the perpendicular section or open stud part is facing upward.
       - The second white 1x2 bracket will be attached similarly on the right side of the structure, symmetrically opposite to the first bracket.

The existing structure should have certain recognizable features such as two grey cylindrical parts towards the sides and two green semi-opaque round tiles. By placing these white brackets on either side of these features, the structure will maintain symmetry and continue the build towards its next stages. These brackets will act as connectors for future pieces providing additional elements or structural support.

This comprehensive step-by-step instruction should assist in understanding how to place the brackets correctly using touch identification and maintaining alignment for the structure even if the instructions cannot be visually observed.

Here is a detailed, step-by-step description of the LEGO building instructions depicted in the image:

**Step 18**

**Required Pieces:**
1. **One (1) dark red LEGO piece:**

   - ID Number: 6141 (Plate 1 x 1 Round)

**Building Instructions:**
1. **Placement of the Dark Red Piece (3x2, ID Number: 3002):**
   - Description: Take the dark red 3x2 brick.
   - Placement: Attach this piece on the top left corner of the existing assembly. Orient the piece horizontally such that its longer side follows the width of the model. The leftmost part of the piece should align flush with the left edge of the model and positioned just above the left wing-like structure.
   
2. **Placement of the Dark Grey Piece (2x2, ID Number: 6141):**
   - Description: Take the dark grey 2x2 piece.
   - Placement: Attach this piece directly in front of the dark red piece you just placed. It should be positioned centrally on the assembly such that it interacts with three other pieces around it to help secure its position.

The placement of each LEGO piece should be done with careful alignment to ensure all studs fit securely into position, maintaining structural integrity as you build upon the previous steps.

Certainly! Let's break down the instructions in the image for someone who is blind. We are on step 19 of the LEGO build.

### Pieces Needed:
1. **2x White 2x3 Plate with Clip (LEGO Part 30350)**
   - Description: This is a flat piece with a 2x3 stud arrangement (2 studs wide and 3 studs long). It has a clip explicitly designed to hold other LEGO elements.
   - Description continues: There is a clip on one side.

2. **2x White Slope 30 1x1x2/3 (LEGO Part 54200)**
   - Description: This is a single stud brick that slopes downwards. Its dimensions are 1 stud wide, 1 stud long, and 2/3 of a brick high, shaped like a small incline or ramp.
   
### Instructions:

1. **Placement of the 2x3 Plate with Clip (2 pieces):**
   - Take the first white 2x3 plate with a clip. From the previous assembly, look for a 2x2 spot located on the right side of the model.
   - Place the first 2x3 plate with a clip on top of this 2x2 area. Make sure that the clip is oriented outward.
   - Repeat the same process on the left side of the model.

2. **Placement of Slope 30 1x1x2/3 (2 pieces):**
   - Take one white slope piece.
   - Locate the previous piece near the front top of the white 2x3 plates you just placed. At the top, there should be a spot for one stud remaining on top of the 2x3 plate.
   - Place the white slope piece on that one stud, ensuring the higher side of the slope is at the back and the lower at the front.
   - Repeat the process for the other side.

**Context:**

- You should now have a model with two extended arms on each side, the slopes aligning on the top, creating an inclined shape toward the back. This will add details to the structure you are building. The clips from the 2x3 plates are positioned outwards and are ready to connect to other LEGO elements in following steps.

Hope this helps in visualizing and constructing the intended LEGO structure!

To understand and follow the instructions in the image, you'll be guided step-by-step for assembling the pieces.

### Step Overview:

This guide outlines the basics needed to get started with your LEGO build, and more

The image provided is an advertisement for LEGO Star Wars Microfighters sets. However, it doesn't include detailed step-by-step building instructions for any specific set. For a complete and accessible description of building instructions for someone who is blind, we'd need specific steps from a LEGO instruction manual. Generally, LEGO manuals are very visual, making it challenging to describe each step and piece verbally without accompanying images. 

Here's a general approach that can be applied, given an appropriate instruction set:

1. **Identify Each Step:**
   Each step typically involves adding one or more pieces to the current model.

2. **Describing Pieces:**
   - Mention the piece's color.
   - Mention the piece’s type (e.g., a brick, a plate, a tile, etc.).
   - Provide its dimensions (e.g., 2x4, 1x2, etc.).
   - If possible, mention its unique LEGO ID number for easy reference.

3. **Placing the Pieces:**
   - Describe where the new pieces should be placed in relation to the existing structure.
   - Use simple, clear directional language (e.g., "attach the 2x2 red plate on the front left corner of the base").

Due to the lack of step-by-step instructions or piece identifications in the image provided, here is a basic example of what the accessible instruction description might look like if we had that information:

---

**Step 1: Building the Base**

- Take a 6x6 gray plate (LEGO ID 3031) and place it flat on your work surface. 

**Step 2: Adding the First Layer**

- Place a 2x4 dark gray brick (LEGO ID 3010) vertically on the bottom row of the 6x6 gray plate from the left side, snapping into the first two columns.

**Step 3: Adding Details**

- Attach a 1x2 light gray tile (LEGO ID 3069) horizontally to the bottom left corner of the 6x6 gray plate, directly adjacent to the 2x4 dark gray brick.
