            "Building Instructions:\nOpen bag 1.\nOpen minifigure group 1.\nAssemble the Ron Weasley minifigure by attaching the torso to the legs, putting the head on the torso,\nand putting the hair on top. Ron is wearing a dirty red sweater and gray pants. One leg of his pants is\nwhite, indicating he\u2019s wearing a cast on that leg! Put a brown 3L bar in his right hand and his wand in his\nleft hand. The 3L bar should extend down to the ground so Ron can use it to help him walk!\nOpen group 1.\n1. The lower floor of the hospital wing has three nearly identical rooms with beds. We\u2019ll start building\nthere. Place a dark tan 8x8 lattice plate in front of you.\n2.1. Place a tan 2x4 brick, horizontally long and centered horizontally, on the back row of the previous\npiece, even with the back of the previous piece.\n2.2. Place a tan 1x2 slope to the left of the previous piece, with the slope at the front. Place another on\nthe right side of the 2x4.\n3.1. Now we will assemble two light brown 1x4 hinge bricks. Find a 1x2 brick which has a downwards\npointing pin on one short end, and a 1x2 brick which has a pin hole at the bottom of one short end. Push\nthe pin from the first piece into the hole on the second, keeping the studs of both pointed up.You can\nopen the hinge to create a 1x4 brick, close the hinge to make a 2x2 brick, or make it some angle in\nbetween. Close the hinge so the hinge brick looks like a 2x2 brick. Note there is a curved bump at the\nside which hinges. Make another hinge brick.\n3.2. Place one 1x4 hinge brick, closed up, with the curved bump at the back, to the left of the left 1x2\nslope. The left half of the hinge brick should overhang to the left of the lattice plate. Place another, in the\nsame orientation, to the right of the right 1x2 slope.\n4. Attach a dark tan 8x8 lattice plate under the overhanging part of the left hinge plate, with its front even\nwith the front of the first lattice plate. Place another symmetrically under the right hinge plate.\n5. Place a tan 1x2 slope to the left of the left hinge brick, with the slope at the front, and the back even\nwith the back of the lattice plate. Place another symmetrically to the right of the right hinge plate.\n6.1. Place a tan 2x4 brick, horizontally long, to the left of the left slope from the previous step. Place\nanother symmetrically to the right of the right slope from the previous step.\n6.2. Find two light brown 1x2 masonry bricks. A masonry brick has a brick wall pattern on one side, and\nhorizontal grooves on the other side. Place one masonry brick, horizontally long, on the back row to the\nleft of the left 2x4 brick from the previous step. The side with both horizontal and vertical grooves should\nbe at the back. Place another symmetrically to the right of the rightmost 2x4 brick.\n6.3. Place a light gray 1x1 brick with a hole on the side, on the leftmost column, in front of the left\nmasonry brick from the previous piece, with the hole at the left. Place another symmetrically in front of the\nmasonry brick on the right side.\n7.1. Place a light brown 1x2 masonry brick, vertically long on the left piece from the previous step,\nextending back one stud so it is even with the back of the build. The side with both horizontal and vertical\ngrooves should be at the right. Place another symmetrically on the right piece from the previous step.\n7.2. Place a tan 1x1 scroll brick to the right of the left previous piece, with the scroll at the back. Scroll\nbricks are a 1x1 brick with a bar sticking out even with the top on one side, which has a stud on top and a\ncircular decoration on the sides. Skip four studs to the right and place another scroll brick in the same\norientation. Skip two more studs and place another scroll brick in the same orientation. Repeat the last\nthree scroll bricks symmetrically on the right side of the build. The scroll bricks should only be placed on\n1x2 slopes, or on 1x2 masonry bricks.\n7.3. Place a light brown 1x1 brick on the back studs of each of the hinge bricks. You should place a total\nof four 1x1 bricks for this step, and each one should touch one scroll brick, and one 1x1 brick.\nOpen group 2.\n8.1. Make six stacks of two tan 2x2 corner bricks.\n8.2. Place one stack, with the studs oriented like a Braille letter J, on the leftmost scroll brick and masonry\nbrick. The back stud on the stack should attach to the decorated scroll on the scroll brick. Place another\nstack, with the studs oriented like a Braille letter H, on the next scroll brick to the right. There should be a\nfour stud gap between this stack and the previous stack. Place another stack, with the studs oriented like\na Braille letter J, to the right of the previous stack. Repeat these three stacks symmetrically on the right\nside of the build.\n9. Place a light brown 1x1 brick in front of the left stud of the leftmost stack from the previous piece. It\nshould be on top of a masonry brick. Put another 1x1 brick on the first. Repeat these two pieces\nsymmetrically on the right side of the build. There should be three breaks in the wall which are four studs\nwide. The windows will go in these gaps!\nOpen group 3 and group 4. Group 3 contains the window frames for the next step, and group 4 contains\nthe window lattice.\n10.1. Assemble a window by attaching a white 1x2x2 lattice into a tan 1x2x2 window frame. Find the lip in\nthe window frame and rotate the window so that it is at the front, then push a lattice in from the front.\nRepeat this eighteen times.\n10.2. Using the windows just created, make six stacks of three windows, keeping all the lattices at the\nfront.\n10.3. Place one stack of windows, with the lattice at the back, to the right of the leftmost stack of corner\nbricks. Place another stack to the right of the first stack. This is the first hospital window! Repeat this in\nthe other two window gaps. There should be a raised row of four studs in front of each window.\nOpen group 5.\n11. Now we\u2019ll start making the hospital beds! First we\u2019ll place the headboards. Place three white 1x4x2\nfences, horizontally long, one on each set of raised studs in front of the windows. These are shaped kind\nof like a capital letter D on its side.\n12. Now to make the beds themselves, there will be three identical beds. Set the hospital wing aside for\nnow. Place a light gray 2x3 plate vertically long in front of you. Stack another 2x3 plate on the first.\n13. Place a white 2x2 plate on the front two rows of the previous piece.\n14.1. Place a white 1x3 jumper plate behind the previous piece. A jumper plate is a 1x2 plate with a single\nstud on top, or a 1x3 plate with only two studs on top. Place another 1x3 jumper plate on the first. These\nare the sheets of the bed.\n14.2. Place a white 1x2 slope tile, horizontally long and centered horizontally, with the thick part at the\nback, on the previous piece. This is the pillow of the bed!\n15. Place a light blue 2x4 curved slope with a 1x4 plate on one side, vertically long, in front of the left stud\nof the previous piece, with the curve on the left. Place another symmetrically to the right of the first. These\nare the hospital blankets on the bed.\n16. Place a white 2x2 brick under the front two rows of the previous two pieces.\n17.1. Place a light blue 2x2 tile in front of the pillow, centered horizontally.\n17.2. Place a light blue 2x2 tile with two studs on top, in front of the previous piece, with the studs at the\nfront. It should be even with the front of the bed.\n17.3. That\u2019s one bed! Now let\u2019s repeat steps 12-17.2 two more times.\n18. Place a hospital bed, vertically long, with the pillow at the back, in front of each headboard, centered\nhorizontally on the headboards.\n19. Make the footboards by placing a white 1x4x2 fence, horizontally long, in front of each bed. These\npieces should be on the front row of the lattice plates.\nOpen bag 2.\nOpen minifigure group 2.\nAssemble the Madam Pomfrey minifigure by attaching the torso on the skirt leg piece, placing the head\non the torso, and putting the combined hair and hat piece on the head. Place a tan wand in her right\nhand.\nAssemble the medical chart by placing a light gray 1x2 plate with two studs hanging down from one long\nside, horizontally long in front of you, with the side studs at the left. Then place a black 2x2 tile, with a\nmedical charts sticker on it, onto the side studs of the previous piece so that it\u2019s even with the top of the\nprevious piece. Madam Pomfrey can hold the chart by putting the flat part of her hand into one of the antistud on the bottom of the 1x2 plate with side studs.\nOpen group 6.\n20.1. Place two tan 1x2x2 tall bricks, horizontally long, in a row on the wall between the left and center\nwindows. Place two more on the wall between the right and center windows.\n20.2.

Place a dark tan 1x4 tile with a stud on each end, horizontally long and centered horizontally, on the\nprevious piece.\n46.3. Place a dark tan 1x6 tile, horizontally long, to the left of the previous piece. Place another to the\nright of the 1x4 tile from the previous step.\nOpen bag 4.\nOpen group 12.\n47.1. Now we\u2019ll start on the clock tower! Set the rest of the hospital wing aside for now. Place a dark tan\n8x8 lattice plate in front of you.\n47.2. Place a tan 1x3x2 concave slope on the right column of the previous piece, even with the front, with\nthe slope at the back. Place another symmetrically on the back of the 8x8 lattice plate.\n48.1. Place a light gray 1x1 brick with a pin-hole on the side to the left of each of the pieces from the\nprevious step, with the holes on the front.\n48.2. Place a light brown 1x1 brick on each of the pieces from the previous step.\n49.1. Place a gold 2x2 curved slope plate, with the studs at the left, between the two concave slopes,\neven with the right side of the lattice plate.\n49.2. Place a dark tan 1x2 plate with a horizontal bar on one long side on the previous piece, with the bar\nat the right.\n49.3. Place a dark tan 1x2 brick with a log pattern, vertically long, on the previous piece.\n50. Place a tan 1x1x3 tall brick on each of the concave slope bricks. These should be in the back right\nand front right corners of the build. Set the clock tower aside for the moment.\nOpen group 13.\n51. Place a dark tan 1x8 plate, horizontally long, in front of you.\n52.1. Place a light brown 1x2 plate, horizontally long and centered horizontally, on the previous piece.\n52.2. Place a dark tan 1x1 plate on the leftmost and rightmost studs of the 1x8 plate.\n53.1. We\u2019re going to make the mount for the clock now. Place a light brown 1x1 brick on each of the\npieces from the previous step.\n53.2. Place a tan 1x2x2 tall brick with four studs on one side to the right of the left piece from the previous\nstep, with the side studs at the front. Place another symmetrically on the right side of the build. These\npieces should go directly on the 1x8 plate.\n53.3. Place a tan 1x2 brick with a pin-hole on the side, horizontally long, between the previous two\npieces. It should go onto a 1x2 plate. This brick will support the clock!\n54.1. Place a light brown 1x2 plate, horizontally long, on the previous piece.\n54.2. Place a dark tan 1x1 plate on the leftmost and another on the rightmost stud of the assembly. The\ntop of this assembly should be level now.\n55. Place a dark tan 1x8 plate, horizontally long, on top of the assembly.\n56.1. Place a sand green 1x2 slope tile, vertically long, on the leftmost column of side studs, with the thick\nside at the left.\n56.2. Place a tan 1x2 tile, vertically long, on the side studs to the right of the previous piece.\n56.3. Repeat steps 56.1-56.2 symmetrically on the right side of the assembly. Rotate the assembly so it is\nvertically long, and the slope tiles are on the right.\n57. Place the rest of the clock tower in front of you, with the concave arches on the right. Keeping the\norientation from the previous step, place the clock mount to the left of the 1x1x3 tall bricks, centered\nvertically. It should attach to a 1x1 brick at the front and back.\nOpen group 14. \n58.1. Now we\u2019ll assemble the face of the clock itself! Place a clear 6x6 dish with a clock pattern on the\nconcave side in front of you, with the studs up. This piece has a hole through the center, and a 2x2 set of\nstuds.\n58.2. Place a tan 1x1 quarter circle tile on the back left stud, with the corner at the back left. Place\nanother to the right of the first, with the corner in the back right. Repeat these two pieces symmetrically on\nthe front two studs. The corners should form a square, and there should be a hole in the center.\n58.3. Rotate the dish so it is upright, with the tiles on the left. The concave side of the dish is marked with\nroman numerals, I through XII. If you have a helper, they have marked the back side dish with a sticker\nwhere the XII is so that we can have the clockface oriented correctly! Push a dark tan 3L axle through the\ncenter hole of the clock face, Push it through from the right, with the stud on the right.\n58.3. Now we\u2019ll attach the clock face to the clock tower. Orient the tower floor with the wall on your right.\nFind the hole on the tower support. This hole is centered vertically on the wall. Keeping the tape mark at\nthe top of the clock face, push the axle from the previous step through the hole in the support. The tiles\non the left side of the clock face should fit in between the tiles on the right side of the clock tower to\nprevent the clock from rotating. You might need to rotate the clock face a little bit to get it perfectly\naligned.\n58.4. Once the clock face is aligned, push a large light gray 40 tooth gear over the axle from the left. This\nwill hole the clock face from falling off. Now, pull the tape off of the clock face. Now, when the gear is\nturned, the axle and stud will turn, but the face of the clock will stay put, since it is held in place by the\ntiles. This is how we\u2019ll make the arms of the clock turn!\n59. Make two stacks of two dark tan 1x1 plates. Stack a light gray 1x1 brick with a pin-hole on each stack.\nPlace a stack, with the hole at the front, on the front stud of the leftmost raised column of bricks. Place\nanother stack on the back stud of this column in the same orientation.\nOpen group 15.\n60.1. Now we\u2019ll continue making the clock mechanism! Place a dark tan 1x2 brick with a log pattern,\nvertically long and centered vertically, between the two stacks from the previous step.\n60.2. Place a dark tan 1x2 plate with a horizontal bar on one long side, on the previous piece with the bar\nat the right.\n60.3. Find two brown 1x1 plates with a ring on one side. The ring has a stud on each side. Place one\npiece, with the ring at the front, on the front stud of the previous piece. Place the other symmetrically\nbehind the first.\n60.4. Place a tan 1x2 brick with a pin-hole, vertically long, in front of you.\n60.5. Place a tan axle/pin combo into the pin-hole of the previous piece by pushing the pin portion in from\nthe left, so the axle extends to the left.\n60.6. Push a medium dark gray 24 tooth gear onto the axle portion of the previous piece from the left.\n60.7. Attach the gear assembly onto the two brown 1x1 plates with rings, with the gear at the left. The\nteeth on this gear should mesh with the teeth on the large gear. When you spin one gear, the other gear\nshould turn!\n61.1. Now we\u2019ll start making the clock tower look a bit more complete! Start by placing a tan 1x8x2 arch,\nvertically long, on the rightmost column of the clock tower. It should be directly over the clock face.\n61.2. Place a tan 1x6x7 arched door frame with round columns, horizontally long with the round columns\nat the front, on the front row of the clock tower, even with the left edge. Place another symmetrically on\nthe back side of the clock tower.\n62.1. Place a tan 1x1 scroll brick on the leftmost stud of the front piece from the previous step, with the\nscroll at the back. Place another symmetrically on the back side of the clock tower.\n62.2. Place a tan 2x2 inverted slope on the second and third studs from the right, on the front of the clock\ntower, with the slope at the back. This should be right in front of the small gear. Place another\nsymmetrically on the back side of the clock tower.\nOpen group 16.\n63.1. Place a dark tan 2x6 plate, horizontally long, on the front two rows of the clock tower, even with the\nleft and front edges. Place another symmetrically on the back two rows.\n63.2. Place a dark tan 1x8 plate, vertically long, to the right of the previous two pieces, aligned with the\nfront of the clock tower.\n63.3. Place a dark tan 1x1 plate to the right of the front stud of the previous piece, and another to the right\nof the back stud of the previous piece. These two should be aligned with the right end of the clock tower.\n63.4. Place a light brown 1x2 plate, vertically long and centered vertically, between the previous two\npieces. Rotate the clock tower so that the clock face is now at the front.\n64.1. Now we\u2019ll build the hands of the clock! Place a black 1x1 circular plate with a short bar sticking out\none side in front of you with the stud facing up. The orientation of the bar is not important. This is the hour\nhand of the clock!\n64.2. Place a black 1x1 circular tile with an upwards pointing bar on the stud of the previous piece.\n64.3. Now we will make the minute hand. Find a black mechanical arm. This piece is about two studs long\nand has a clip at each end. Attach one clip onto the upwards bar from the previous piece. It should be\nable to spin around the bar 360 degrees, just like the minute hand of a clock! Arrange the hands how you\nwould like them, and attach them to the center stud on the clock face. You can now turn them by rotating\nthe small gear.\n65.1. Now we\u2019ll make another small clock. Place a gold 1x1 circular plate in front of you.\n65.2. Place a sand green 1x1 cone on the previous piece.\n65.3. Place a brown 2x2 circular plate with a clock pattern on it, on the previous piece. Attach this piece\nusing the center anti-stud, so it is centered horizontally and vertically on the previous piece.\n65.4. Now, rotate this on its side, with the circular tile at the front. Rotate it so the mark indicating the top\nof the clock is up. Now attach it to the right 1x1 plate with a ring which is behind the large clock face. It\nmight be difficult to find this from the front, so you might be able to remove the smaller gear and find the\nplate with a ring from behind, then use that to guide your placement of the small clock. Don\u2019t forget to\nreplace the gear when you are done if you take it off! Once you have the small clock placed and oriented\ncorrectly, you can remove the tape from that tile.\n66. Place a sand green 1x1 cone on each corner of the clock tower.\n67.1. Place a tan 1x2x2 tall slope to the right of the front left cone from the previous step, with the slope at\nthe left. Place another symmetrically on the right side of the clock tower.\n67.2. Place a sand green 1x2 slope tile, with the thick side at the right, behind the left stud on the left\npiece from the previous step. Place two more in a row behind the first, in the same orientation. Repeat\nthese three pieces symmetrically on the right side of the clock tower.\nOpen group 17.\n68. Now we\u2019ll build some more of the clock mechanism! Set the clock tower aside for now. Place a tan\n1x2 brick with a pin-hole, vertically long, in front of you.\n69.1. Place a dark gray 4L axle with a stop into the hole on the previous piece, pushing it in from the right\nwith the stop on the right.\n69.2. Push a small dark gray 8 tooth gear onto the previous piece, pushing it on from the left side until it\ntouches the 1x2 brick. Don\u2019t push too hard, we want the axle to turn freely!\n70. Place a dark tan 2x2 plate under the 1x2 brick, extending one column to the right.\n71. Place a light brown 1x2 plate, vertically long, on the right column of the previous piece.\n72.1. Place a tan 2x2 inverted slope on the previous piece, with the slope at the right.\n72.2. Place a light brown 1x2 plate, vertically long to the left of the previous piece. Its top should be even\nwith the top of the previous piece.\n73. Slide a tan 12 tooth bevel gear onto the axle. Push it on from the left, with the flat part of the gear at\nthe right.\n74. Place the clock tower in front of you, with the clock face at the right. Attach the mechanism we just\ncreated on the clock tower, between the two tall slopes on the right column. The axle should be at the left,\nand the teeth of the small dark gray gear should mesh with the teeth of the medium gear on the clock\ntower. If you spin the axle, the hands on the clock should spin!\n75.1. Now we\u2019ll make the arch at the left end of the clock tower. Place a sand green 1x1 plate behind the\n1x1 cone at the front left corner of the clock tower. Place another in front of the cone on the back left\ncorner.\n75.2. Place a tan 1x6 arch, vertically long, so that it connects to both pieces from the previous step.\n75.3. Place a sand green 1x1 slope tile on the front stud of the previous piece, with the thick side at the\nback.\n75.4. Place a dark tan 2x2 corner plate behind the previous piece, oriented like a Braille letter F,\noverhanging the arch by one stud to the right.\n75.5. Repeat steps 75.3-75.4 symmetrically on the back side of the arch.\n76. Place a tan 1x2x2 tall slope on the front corner plate on the left arch, aligned with the left end of the\nclock tower, with the slope at the front. Place another symmetrically behind it. Place another pair of tall\nslopes, in the same orientation, on the two tall slopes on the right side of the clock tower.\nOpen group 18.\n77. Now we\u2019ll start building the roof of the clock tower, which also contains more of the mechanism for\nturning the hands of the clock! Set the clock tower aside for now. Place a light gray 2x6 plate with holes\nhorizontally long in front of you. The holes are hard to notice because they are between the studs, but\nthey\u2019re there!\n78.1. Place a dark tan 2x2 circular tile with a hole in the middle, centered vertically and horizontally, on\nthe previous piece.\n78.2. Place a dark tan 2x2 plate to the left of the previous piece, and another to the right of it.\n79. Place a brown 1x2 hinge base, horizontally long with the tall side at the back, on the front row of each\nof the previous pieces. Place two more symmetrically behind the first.\n80.1. Find a brown 5L axle with a stop on one end. Hold the axle so the stop is at the bottom and push a\ntan 12 tooth bevel gear onto it from the top, with the flat part of the axle on the top. Push the gear all the\nway down to the stop.\n80.2. Push the axle and gear up through the center hole of the 2x6 plate from the bottom. Hold onto the\naxle so it doesn\u2019t fall through!\n81.1. Slide a tan 1L thick liftarm down over the axle from the top. This piece looks like a hollow cylinder.\n81.2. Slide a light gray thin bushing over top of the axle, pushing it down until it touches the previous\npiece, and the previous piece touches the 2x2 circular tile. With this in place, the axle is secured and\nwon\u2019t fall out! Once again, make sure you don\u2019t push the bushing down too hard. We want the axle to spin\nfreely!\n82. Put the clock tower back in front of you, with the clock face at the right. Place the assembly we just\ncreated, centered vertically, between the two sets of tall slopes. The bevel gear on the roof assembly\nshould engage with the bevel gear attached to the small gear. Now, when you turn the axle on top of the\nclock tower, the clock hands should turn!\nOpen group 19.\n83.1. All that\u2019s left to do now is to make the roof! Place a sand green 4x6 plate horizontally long in front of\nyou, with the studs down.\n83.2. Place a brown 2x2 hinge plate on the previous piece, even with the back left corner, with the flat\npart at the front. Place another on the back right corner in the same orientation. Keeping the hinge plates\nat the back, flip the 4x6 plate over so the studs are up.\n83.3. Place a sand green 1x1 slope tile on the third stud from the left on the back row, with the thick part\nat the back. Place another on the second stud from the left on the second row from the front, with the\nthick part at the back. Place another on the second stud from the right on the front row, with the thick part\nat the back.\n83.4. Repeat steps 83.1-83.3 to make the second half of the roof.\n83.5. Attach the front roof section by attaching the hinge plates onto the hinge bases we already placed\non the clock tower. Do this by holding the roof section flat in front of you, with the hinge plates at the back.\nLine the hinge plates up with the base and push straight down until they both click into place, then hinge\nthe roof down as far as it will go. Repeat this symmetrically on the back side of the clock tower.\n84. Place a light brown 2x8 plate with holes, horizontally long and centered vertically, on top of the clock\ntower. It should be aligned with the left and right ends of the clock tower, and the axle should stick up out\nof the middle of it.\n85.1. Place a dark tan 2x2 circular tile with a hole in the middle, centered horizontally on the previous\npiece. It should go down over the axle.\n85.2. Place a sand green 1x2 double slope, vertically long and centered vertically, on the leftmost column\nof the roof. Rotate the clock tower so the clock face is at the front.\n85.3. Find the inverted slope overhanging the clock face. Place a light brown 1x2 plate, horizontally long,\non the inverted slope.\n85.4. Assemble a window by placing a white 1x2x2 lattice into a tan 1x2x2 arched window panel. Place\nthe window panel onto the 1x2 plate from the previous step, with the flat side of the panel at the front.\n86.1. Place a tan 2x2 circular brick on the previous piece, even with the front of the clock tower.\n86.2. Place a sand green 2x2 jagged cone on top of the previous piece.\n86.3. Place a sand green unicorn horn, with the point up, into the stud on top of the previous piece.\n86.4. Place a tan 2x2 circular brick onto the axle on top of the roof. The axle connects through an axle\nhole in the center of the circular brick, so the circular brick should be aligned with the 2x2 circular tile on\ntop of the roof. Place another tan 2x2 circular brick on the first one.\n86.5. Place a sand green 2x2 jagged cone on top of the previous piece.\n86.6. Place a sand green unicorn horn, with the point up, into the stud on top of the previous piece. You\ncan rotate this spire to turn the clock hands!!\n87. Place the entire hospital wing in front of you with the windows at the front. Attach the clock tower, with\nthe clock at the front, to the hospital wing, centering it horizontally between the two small roofs. The front\nof the clock tower should extend two studs past the front of the hospital wing so it is even with the two\nsmall half arches overhanging to the front.\nCongratulations! Now the Hogwarts Hospital Wing is complete!\nThank you so much for building this set!"

            "Welcome to text-based instructions from LEGO for the Blind. Before you start building, here are some\nterms we\u2019ll be using:\n- Front: towards you.\n- Back: away from you.\n- Up: towards the ceiling.\n- Down: towards the floor.\n- Stud: the bump on a Lego brick. Example: A 2x1 brick has two studs on it.\n- Vertically: going from front to back.\n- Horizontally: going from left to right.\n- Upright: pointing up towards the ceiling, and down towards the floor.\n- Symmetrically: a mirror image. Example: If you place a 2x1 brick with technic connector on the front wall\nat the right, connector to the front, and then place another such piece symmetrically on the back wall, at\nthe right, the technic connector of the second piece should point to the back, since it will be placed\nsymmetrically.\nFor builders with low vision, or a sighted building partner may want to follow along with the printed visual\ninstructions that come with each kit or PDF versions are always online at LEGO.com for each set\n(https://www.lego.com/en-us/service/buildinginstructions/60394).

        "sorting": [
            "To begin a successful build, it helps to sort the pieces into groups, bags, or small containers. Have a\nfriend or family member do this in advance following the instructions below. You will see that the pieces\nshould be sorted according to the building steps in the kit. Doing this in advance makes locating the\npieces for each step easier. See below on how to sort the pieces to correspond to the steps in this set.\nNumber the containers using letters A-Z, numbers, or meaningful names. The parts will be sorted into one\nor a small number of steps in the instructions. Example: Steps 1-3 means collect all the parts used in\nsteps 1, 2 and 3, and put them in one container.\nBags 1 & 2 (not numbered) and two large pieces (one 6x6 plate in bright green, and one 6x6 plate with\nbow in bright azure) \u2013 10 groups of bricks\nMinifigure Parts \u2013 legs, torso, head, hair, helmet, goggles\nFirst assembly (ATV) \u2013 Steps 1-4, 5-8, 9-13, 14-19, 20\nSecond assembly (otter habitat) \u2013 Steps 1-6, 7-13, 14-21, 22-26\nConstruct the park ranger minifigure using the legs, torso, and head. There are two options for\nheadpieces: long brown hair, and a bright green helmet with white goggles. The helmet is assembled by\nclipping the white goggles to the front of the bright green helmet. The notch in the bottom of the goggles\nshould fit the triangular peak in the helmet\u2019s chinstrap. The park ranger has dark green legs and a torso\nshowing a sand-green button-down shirt. She proudly wears a golden badge over her heart which marks\nher as a park ranger. The ranger has light freckles and two expressions: a determined smile, and a squint\nas though she were looking one-eyed through a camera\u2019s viewfinder.\nLet\u2019s begin by building the ranger\u2019s ATV:\n1. Start by locating one black 2x2 bearing element. It has four studs arranged in a square on top with two\nbars sticking out of the side of the piece. Orient the element so that the bars are aligned vertically.\n2. Take the dark grey 2x6 plate and orient it horizontally. Connect the bearing directly under the right end\nof the 2x6 plate.\n3. Find the translucent red 1x2 plate, which will act as the rear lights of the ATV. Place it vertically at the\nrightmost end of the dark grey 2x6 plate.\n4. Locate a light grey 1x2 plate with two vertical clips and another black 2x2 bearing. Put the 2x2 with\nbearing vertically on the table. Connect the 1x2 plate with vertical clips vertically to the left column of the\nbearing with the clips to the left.\n5. Connect the green 2x6 plate horizontally to the left of red 1x2 plate at the right end of the structure.\n6. Locate the dark grey 1x2 plate with 1x2 side studs and connect it to the left end of the assembly so that\nthe side studs face to the left. Put a tan 2x2 plate to the right of the previous piece. Place another tan 2x2\nplate at the right end of the assembly.\n7. We will now create a place to store some minifigure accessories! Locate a white 1x1 plate with\nhorizontal clip and a dark grey 1x1 plate with vertical clip. At the right-hand end of the structure, connect\nthe white 1x1 plate with vertical clip on the back stud and the grey 1x1 plate with horizontal clip on the\nfront stud. The clips should face to the right.\n8. Take the black mini handle and align it vertically with the bars protruding to the right. Connect it to the\nright-hand side of the build so that the bars sit on either side of the 1x1 plates with clips.\n9. Collect a dark tan 2x2 plate and a light grey 1x2 sloped tile. Place the 2x2 plate on the left end of the\nATV. Immediately to the right of the newly placed plate, connect the light grey slope with the sloped side\nfacing to the right. This piece is decorated with dials and resembles a vehicle\u2019s dashboard.\n10. Find a reddish brown 1x2 brick with outside half bow and orient it with the curved side facing left.\nConnect the brick to the ATV directly to the handle piece\u2019s left. You should have a 1x2 stud space to the\nleft of the curved brick in which for the minifigure to stand.\n11. Locate two green mudguards. Orient both mudguard elements so that the overhangs face left.\nConnect one mudguard to the 2x2 studded area at the left end of the ATV \u2013 this region sits immediately to\nthe left of the light grey slope that serves as a dashboard. Connect the other to the right end of the vehicle\n\u2013 this area sits directly to the right of the smooth curved brick and is terminated by the horizontal and\nvertical clips.\n12. Take the dark grey 1x2 tile with one stud and orient it vertically. Connect the plate to the right end of\nthe left mudguard, to the immediate left of the 1x2 slope. Locate a translucent red 1x2 plate and orient it\nvertically. Connect the plate to the mudguard at the right end of the build such that the right edge lies flush\nwith the back end of the vehicle.\n13. Find two tan 1x2 sloped tiles and orient them with their sloped sides facing left. Connect one vertically\nto the left mudguard element, immediately to the left of the 1x2 plate with center stud. The other should\nbe connected vertically to the right mudguard element, immediately to the left of the transparent red 1x2\nplate.\n14. Collect a tan 1x2 plate and a 1x1 modified tile with a clip. Orient the 1x2 plate vertically and place it on\ntop of the transparent red 1x2 plate at the right end of the build, to the immediate right of the tan slope\nfrom the last step. Connect the 1x1 plate with upright holder to the dark grey 1x2 plate with center stud at\nthe left end of the ATV, immediately to the right of the tan slope placed there. The clip should be aligned\nso that the prongs of the clip form a horizontal line.\n15. Locate the black handle with stick element, which is used here as a handlebar. Attach the handle to\nthe model by clipping the central unit to the 1x1 plate with upright holder at the left end of the vehicle. You\nshould hear a \u2018click\u2019 when the connection is made.\n16. Connect the metallic silver radiator grille horizontally to the two vertical studs on the left end of the\nATV to form the vehicle\u2019s air intake.\n17. Locate the black front fender. Connect the fender to the left end of the ATV by clipping the bottom bar\ninto the vertical clips at left. The fender can then be swung upwards to lie flat against the grille piece from\nthe last step.\n18. Rotate the build 90 degrees clockwise so the horizontal and vertical clips at the back of the ATV face\nyou. Locate the walkie-talkie minifigure accessory and attach it to the ATV by connecting the handle to the\nwhite horizontal clip on the right. The antenna should point upwards.\n19. Next, let\u2019s make the camera: Collect a clear 1x1 round tile and the camera piece. Find the stud on the\nfront of the camera and connect the 1x1 round tile to the stud to give the camera a lens. Connect the\ncompleted camera to the dark grey vertical clip on the left, next to the walkie talkie. You will have to\nreorient the camera so that the handle aligns with the clip. Once connected, push the camera down so\nthat it lies against the back of the ATV.\n20. Locate 4 white wheel rims and 4 black tires. Push one rim into each tire to create 4 wheels. Connect\nthe wheels to the vehicle by carefully aligning the small hole in the back of each wheel rim with an axle\nand pushing gently but firmly. You should feel the wheels slot in to place with a \u2018click\u2019.\nCongratulations, you have finished building the ATV! In the instruction book, there is an illustration of the\nhelmeted park ranger riding the ATV by standing in the centre and holding the handlebars.\nNow we can build a habitat for the otters! The habitat features a grassy region and a pool of water, with a\nrocky area shaded by a tree. From the top of the rocks, a stream or waterfall flows down into the water.\n1. We begin with the grassy area. Find the green 6x6 plate.\n2. Put a bright green plant grass stem on the 6x6 plate's back left stud, curled top to the left.\n3. Collect a dark grey 2x2 sloped brick and connect it to the 6x6 plate so that the piece lies against the\ndirectly to the right of the plant stem with the slope facing left.\n(Note: steps 3 and 4 have been reversed from the visual instructions because it makes the model easier\nto assemble on a flat surface.)\n4. Place the blue 6x6 plate with bow to the right of the green 6x6 plate and hold in place. The curve of the\nblue plate should be to the front right. Take a black 2x4 brick and place it horizontally to the right of the\nsloped brick. The brick should connect to both plates, securing them in place.\n5. Locate a brown 1x4 plate and a light grey 1x1 round plate. Orient the brown 1x4 plate horizontally and\nconnect it to the back row of studs to the right of the black 2x4 brick. To the right of the newly placed 1x4\nplate, add the 1x1 round plate. The round plate should occupy the back right corner of the assembly.\n6. Find the tan 1x2 plate and place it horizontal in front of the 2x4 brick so that the right edge of the plate\nlies along the right edge of the brick. Then take the dark green 2x2 tile directly in front of the plate you just\nplaced. Both pieces should help to strengthen the connection across the 6x6 plates.\n7. Locate a light grey 1x2 brick and orient it vertically. Place it so that it lies to the left of the plate and tile\nfrom the previous step, and in front of the 2x4 brick.\n8. Next, locate another dark grey 2x2 sloped brick and place it horizontally to the left of the grey 1x2 brick\nwith the slope facing you. Place a light grey 1x1 round plate directly on the green 6x6 plate one stud\nforward and to the left of the front left corner of the previous piece.\n9. Collect a light blue 2x4 tile and a light blue 2x2 curved sloped tile. Align the 2x4 tile horizontally and\nplace it on the blue 6x6 plate so that it lies in front of the brown 1x4 plate. Orient the 2x2 curved sloped\ntile so that the slope curves down to the right and connect it to the right of the 2x4 tile. The right end of\nthis piece should hang over the edge of the plate, and that is OK! Together, the pieces form a smooth\nsurface that mimics running water.\n10. Locate a reddish brown 2x1x2 sloped brick. Orient the piece horizontally so the slope faces to the\nright and connect it at the back of the model to the right of the 2x4 brick, leaving three studs between this\npiece and the back right corner of the model. To the immediate right of the sloped brick, place a bright\ngreen plant grass stem with the top curling to the right.\n11. Take another reddish brown 2x1x2 sloped brick and orient it horizontally with the sloped edge facing\nto the left. Place the brick to the left of the first sloped brick so that their flat sides touch. The newly placed\nbrick should sit higher than the other sloped brick. Together, the slopes form the trunk of a tree. Collect a\nlight grey 1x2 brick and place it horizontally to the left of the previous piece.\n12. Place a dark grey 2x2 sloped brick in front of the 1x2 brick with the slope facing left. There should be\na vertical 1x3 area of free studs to the piece\u2019s left. We have now completed the rocky section of the\nhabitat!\n13. Create a part: locate a reddish brown 1x2 plate with 2x2 vertical studs on the side and a tan 1x2 plate.\nPlace the 1x2 plate on top of the two studs of the reddish-brown plate so there is no overhang. Orient the\npart from the previous step so that the 2x2 vertical studs on the side face you. Locate the dark green tile\nin the front middle of the build and follow it back until you feel two studs. Connect the part to the model\nhere so the left edge lies against the edge of the habitat\u2019s rocky section.\n14. Collect a reddish-brown 1x2 rocker bearing, which will be used in the creation of a waterfall linking the\nstony area and the pool. Orient the piece vertically so that the flat edge faces to the left and place behind\nthe 2x2 vertical studs and to the immediate right of a dark grey sloped brick.\n15. Locate two blue 1x2 plates and orient them vertically. Place one on the two studs immediately to the\nright of the rocker bearing placed in the previous step, and the second to the immediate left of the rocker\nbearing and one stud back. The back edge of the plate should align with the back of the build. These\npieces begin to suggest that the pool is fed by a stream from beyond the rocks.\n16. Make a part: locate the round 2x2 tile with wood detailing and a dark brown round 2x2 brick with fluted\nprofile. Connect the tile to the brick. This part looks like a log! Orient the part with the flat tiled end facing\nyou and connect it to the 2x2 vertical studs in front of the rocker bearing.\n17. Locate two lime green 1x1 plant plates and orient them so that the point of the middle leaf faces you.\nConnect one to the left stud in front of the log assembly, and the other two studs to the left and one back.\n18. Place the dark green frog piece on top of the first plant piece and a lavender 1x1 flower plate on top of\nthe second plant piece.\n19. Take a light grey 1x2 brick and orient it vertically. Connect the brick to the model immediately to the\nright of the log assembly. Next to the 1x2 brick, place a dark grey 2x2 sloped brick with the slope facing\nright.\n20. Make a part: take the blue 2x6 tile and orient it horizontally. Connect it to the black 2x2 rocking plate\nwith no overhang so that the rounded part of its underside aligns with the left edge of the tile. This part will\nact as a stream or waterfall from the rocks down to the water. Connect the part to the terrain via the\nrocker bearing behind the log assembly. Align the part carefully and push down on the left end until you\nhear a \u2018click\u2019. Then, push gently on the right end of the tile to hinge the part down until it touches the tiles\nbeneath. There is now a smooth slope leading from the top of the rocky area down to the pool down\nwhich the otters can slide!\n21. Locate a dark grey 2x2 sloped brick and place it horizontally on top of the 2x2 studded region to the\nright of the log with the slope facing you. We have now finished the rocky section of the terrain and can\ncomplete the tree.\n22. Take the two reddish brown 1x3x3 bricks with bows. Locate the 2x1x2 reddish brown sloped bricks at\nthe back of the build to the left of the rightmost green plant stem piece at the back of the build and\nconnect a brick with bows to each. The left brick with bows should overhang to the left, and the right brick\nwith bows should overhang to the right. These pieces make up the branches of our tree.\n23. Find the dark brown slope with stud cut-out. Orient the piece so the slope faces to the right and\nconnect between the bricks with bows.\n24. Finally, we can give our tree some foliage! Locate two dark green small limb elements, which\nresemble leafy branches. Place one piece on the right stud of the right brick with bow and the other on\nthe left stud of the same brick. Then, connect a bright green 1x2 tile with 1 knob across the studs of the\nlimb elements to strengthen the connection.\n25. Repeat the last step for the left arch: take two dark green small limb elements and place one on each\nstud of the left reddish brown brick with bows to form the rest of the canopy. Then, find a bright green 1x2\nplate with 1 knob and connect it to the limb elements where they connect to the brown arch.\n26. Collect the silver fish and brown otter figures and place them wherever you like in the habitat.\nCongratulations, you have completed the otter habitat!\nThe instructions show that two reddish brown otters have made their home here, alongside a silver fish.\nThe otters can be released from the top of the smooth blue ramp to slide down into the pool at its base.\nThere is an illustration of the park ranger taking photos of the habitat, having dismounted her ATV. One\notter stands at the top of the rocky area, while the other seems very interested in the fish!\nThank you so much for building this set!"

            "Sorting the pieces:\nTo begin a successful build, it helps to sort the pieces into groups, bags, or small containers. Have a\nfriend or family member do this in advance following the instructions below. You will see that the pieces\nshould be sorted according to the building steps in the kit. Doing this in advance makes locating the\npieces for each step easier. See below on how to sort the pieces to correspond to the steps in this set.\nNumber the containers using letters A-Z, numbers, or meaningful names. The parts will be sorted into one\nor a small number of steps in the instructions. Example: Steps 1-3 means collect all the parts used in\nsteps 1,2 and 3, and put them in one container.\nThis LEGO set comes with 2 small unlabeled bags, 1 set of instructions, and some loose pieces. Sort the\npieces into groups or piles as described below. Note that where there are multiple colors of the same\nbrick in a step, the colors will be split into 2 groups to make telling the difference easier for the builder!\nLEGO includes a few spare parts in case you lose something. Set these into their own group away from\nthe rest, in case you need them later.\nNote: I will identify steps by page numbers according to the instruction booklets.\nBags 1 and 2 of 2 (groups/piles):\nGroup 1 has the pieces for page 5.
