**Build:**
Once there was a LEGO sailor who built a sailboat. He assembled a blue piece (1x3 flat in the middle, 2x4 on one side, 1x2 on the other side). Next, he attached a 2x1 piece with arm/eye in the groove. After that, he added a T-beam horizontally. Then, he slid a 2x1 in the vertical grooves. He put a faucet piece on top and inserted a stick, which he tied in a knot and cut with scissors. He slid a curved piece with a hole on top and mounted a ladder. He secured chairs on either side, inserted a cylinder to create a joint, and attached a 1x2 concave piece to it. He made a sandwich of 2x2 flat pieces and attached more cylinders. Finally, he attached mountaineering shoes with laces for the ladder and crafted a wedge to support the mast.

1. Place a 2x2 piece vertically on the table.
2. Add another 2x2 piece vertically behind the first to create a lip.
3. Attach a 2x1 flat piece with holes to the left of the lip.
4. Add a 2x1 flat piece behind the lip to form extensions on the left and back.
5. Construct the mast using cylinders and mount the sail.
6. Attach a flag to the bow of the ship.
7. Insert the point of the ship's wheel into the faucet piece, then into the hole on the left extension.
8. Your sailboat is complete! Thank you for building it.
