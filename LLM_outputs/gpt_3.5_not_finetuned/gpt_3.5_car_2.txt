Story:
In a bustling city, a new food truck named "Brick Bites" was about to hit the streets. The owner, a creative Lego enthusiast, designed the truck entirely out of Lego bricks. The truck was colorful and eye-catching, perfect for attracting hungry customers. With a menu full of delicious treats, the owner couldn't wait to share their passion for both food and building with the world.
