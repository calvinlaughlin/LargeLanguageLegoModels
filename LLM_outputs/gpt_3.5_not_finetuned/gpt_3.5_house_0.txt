Story:
In a quaint little town, there stood a charming house that was loved by all its residents. It had a lovely front porch, big windows that let in lots of light, and a cozy interior perfect for a family to call home. The Lego set you are about to build is a miniature version of this beloved house, complete with all its details.

Step by Step Guide:

2. On top of the 2x4 bricks, stack three 2x2 bricks and two 2x2 plates to create the front wall of the house.
3. Attach a 1x4 brick to the top of the front wall to act as a support for the roof.
4. Place a 1x2 plate on each side of the front wall to create the windows.
5. Insert a window piece into each of the 1x2 plates to complete the windows.
6. Attach a 1x4 plate on top of the front wall to create the roof base.
7. Place a door piece in the center of the front wall to create the entrance to the house.
8. Stack two 2x2 bricks on either side of the front wall to create the side walls of the house.
9. Attach a roof piece on top of the 1x4 plate to complete the roof of the house.
10. Finish by adding any additional details or decorations to personalize your Lego house.
