Build steps:
- Place a light grey 2x2 inverted slope under the back. Attach an orange 2x2 rocket fuel container, rotate its "wide" end to the left.
- Assemble an inverted dish on top of a short grey stick. Attach to the side of the fuel container.
- Make three sets of grey tubes of increasing length, with blue domes for the antenna. Attach to the back right, back left, and front right.
- Assemble two stick-antenna pairs with connectors and rods. Insert smaller rods into their sockets.
- Attach the sticks to the spaceship.
- Place a light grey 2x4 plate to the left of the ship.
- Build the legs using cones and F-shaped pieces, then attach them to the ship.
- Make hose and gun pieces for thrusters and attach them.
- Assemble a geophone from various pieces and place it inside the spaceship.
- Finally, make a small ROWR robot by assembling specific pieces accordingly.
Enjoy your spaceship! Subsequent steps of numbering are omitted since the device is completed. 1. (Part 1: Pneumatic Hose 2mm D. 15L - 6762a; Part 2: Bar 3L - 87994; Part 3: Action Figure Blaster Short - 15392; Part 4: Water tap - 4599b)
a. Insert Part 1 into the thick end of Part 2, aligning the pieces symmetrically.
b. Connect Part 3 to the unoccupied end of Part 1, with the trigger facing vertically.
c. Assemble Part 4 by inserting a stud into one end and attaching a bar to the other end. Place the thinner end between the ends of a 2x2 rounded tile.
2. (Part 5: Axle/Pin 3L - 11135; Part 6: Technic connector 4W - 6632b; Part 7: Antenna - 2569a)
a. Insert Part 5 into the end of the hose, thread it through the spaceship, and attach it to Part 6 by snapping it in.
b. Connect Part 7 to the free end of the hose, aligning the parts horizontally.
3. (Part 8: Flip pad - 18575; Part 9: Plate 4x4 circular - 26599)
a. Place Part 8 upside down on the table. Attach Part 9 to the stud on the back of the spaceship, aligning the stud with the hole in Part 9.
