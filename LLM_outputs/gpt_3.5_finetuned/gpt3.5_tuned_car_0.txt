Building a LEGO Car:
- LEGO Parts: PART1, PART2, PART3, PART4
- Story: A race car driver and his dad were about to take on some exciting races. The team was ready to hit the track - would you like to help them assemble the car?

1. Place one of the black wide axle connectors with the thin cylinder ends horizontal and facing forward on the table.
2. Insert a black 2x2 cross axle connector with the cross in to the rear left pin.
3. Place a high-stepped orange wheel over the smooth vertical axle.
4. Attach a light-gray wide truck wheel to the rear of the axle, and a round silver plate to its top.
5. Add a black wide-stance crew truss to the front.

Enjoy your new LEGO car! Thank you for joining the team.
