Place the steering wheel you assembled earlier into the opening between the two rear seats. The control levers at the front inside the car allow you to drive the car. Turn the steering wheel left and right to change direction. When you turn the steering wheel, the front wheels also change direction. Please fasten your seat belt and let's drive.

The car has a movable crane at the front. You can turn and lift it easily. After driving to the desired location, you can use the cable spool to pull items towards you. The remote control at the back can help you control the hook. Have fun playing with the car!
