### The Story

In the land of Middle-earth, nestled in the hills of Rohan, stands a mighty fortress, a symbol of strength and unity. This castle, often the herald of hope against the encroaching darkness, is home to many valiant heroes from the tales of old. Aragorn, the true heir of Isildur, Legolas, the elven prince, and Gimli, the stout-hearted dwarf, have gathered within its walls to plan their next move against the forces of Sauron. As they prepare for battle, we too shall construct this bastion of hope brick by brick.

### Step-by-Step Guide

**Step 1:** 
- Start with securing the **Baseplate (32x32 studs - Part no. 3811)** as your foundation.

**Step 2:**
- Place a **Brick 2x4 dark grey (3011)** along the bottom edge of the baseplate, starting from the left corner.
- Add another **Brick 2x4 dark grey (3011)** directly to the right of the first, following the bottom edge.
- Continue placing **Bricks 2x4 dark grey (3011)** until you fill the entire bottom row.

**Step 3:**
- Stack **Bricks 1x4 dark grey (3010)** and **Bricks 2x4 dark grey (3011)** to build up walls around the periphery of the baseplate. Alternate between these sizes to ensure stability of the walls.
- Build up to at least 4 layers for each side.

**Step 4:**
- Wherever needed, use **Brick 1x2 dark grey (3004)** and **Brick 1x1 dark grey (3005)** to fill small gaps and to support corners.

**Step 5:**
- On the front wall of your castle, leave a space 4 studs wide and 6 bricks high for the **Door Frame 1x4x6 dark grey (60596)**. 

**Step 6:**
- Attach the **Castle Gate (4448)** inside the door frame.
- Secure the door frame in place with surrounding **Brick 2x2 dark grey (3003)** and **Brick 1x4 dark grey (3010).**

**Step 7:**
- Use **Plate 1x4 dark grey (3710)** and **Plate 2x4 dark grey (3020)** to create parapets along the top edge of the front wall.
- Continue wrapping these plates around the top edge of remaining walls.

**Step 8:**
- Insert **Windows 1x2x2 dark grey (60594)** into pre-built gaps within the wall at strategic locations for a fortified look.

**Step 9:**
- Build the top battlements with **Slope 45 2x2 dark grey (3039)** and **Slope 45 2x1 dark grey (3040)** to create the distinctive medieval castle look.

**Step 10:**
- Place the **Flag (60756)** on top of the two tallest turrets in the corners of the castle for a regal finish.

**Step 11:**
- Add the **Minifigures: Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli** at the front gate, ready to protect their fortress.

**Step 12:**
- Equip your minifigures with their respective **Weapon Accessories (swords, bows, axes)** for completeness.
