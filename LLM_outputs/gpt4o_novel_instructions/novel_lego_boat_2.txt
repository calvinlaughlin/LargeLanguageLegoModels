## Story:

In the quiet coastal village of Brickshore, people rely on sturdy rowboats for fishing and exploring the nearby islands. Old Captain Brickbeard, an experienced sailor, has decided to teach young builders the art of constructing the perfect rowboat. Follow his detailed instructions to create a dependable LEGO rowboat that can bravely navigate the calm and sometimes turbulent waters of Brickshore Bay.

## Step-by-Step Build Guide:

### Step 1: Creating the Base
- Take **1 x LEGO Plate 4x10 (#3030)** and place it flat. This will be the base of your rowboat.

### Step 2: Building the Bottom Layer
- Attach **2 x LEGO Plate 2x4 (#3020)** across the middle of the 4x10 plate, leaving a 2-stud buffer on either end.

### Step 3: Adding Structure to the Sides
- Place **2 x LEGO Plate 1x4 (#3710)** on the sides of the 2x4 plates, creating a rectangular shape.

### Step 4: Introducing the Oar Holders
- Attach **2 x LEGO Tile 1x2 With Handle (#30060)** on the outer sides of the 1x4 plates. These handles will hold the oars.

### Step 5: Side Supports
- Place **2 x LEGO Brick 1x4 with Studs on Sides (#30414)** on top of the handles on each side. These will serve as the side supports and provide extra stability.

### Step 6: Shaping the Rowboat
- Attach **8 x LEGO Curved Slope 3x1 (#50950)** along the top edges of the side supports (1x4 brick with studs on sides). Use 4 pieces on each side to form a curved contour, resembling the shape of a boat.

### Step 7: Front and Back Details
- Add **4 x LEGO Plate 1x2 (#3023)** two on the front and two on the back to cover exposed studs, finishing the details of the front and back.

### Step 8: Decking
- Take your **LEGO Plate 6x10 (#30332)** and place it centrally on the top, connecting the supports and covering the entire structure to form the boat's deck.

### Step 9: Finishing Touch
- Attach **1 x LEGO Tile 1x6 (#6636)** across the middle of the 6x10 plate for decorative finishing and extra stability.

### Step 10: Adding the Oars
- Finally, place **2 x LEGO Minifigure Paddle/Oar (#47996)** on either side of the boat, attaching them to the 1x2 handles. These represent the rowing oars.

And there you have it! Captain Brickbeardâ€™s rowboat is now complete. Ready to embark on adventures across Brickshore Bay or to catch the biggest fish in the sea. Happy Building!
