### Small Story about the Build

In the bustling town of Bricksville, a new delivery truck is needed to transport goods from the recently opened supermarket to homes and shops across the town. The truck is essential for ensuring everyone in Bricksville has access to their favorite snacks, toys, and supplies. Today, we're going to build this essential Lego Truck, piece by piece, to ensure timely deliveries and happy citizens.

### Step-by-Step Guide for Building the Lego Truck

#### Step 1: Creating the Base
- Take the 2 x 4 Plate (3020) and place it as the base.
- Attach one 1 x 4 Plate (3710) to the front of the 2 x 4 Plate.

#### Step 2: Building the Chassis
- Attach a 2 x 2 Plate (3022) to the back of the 2 x 4 Plate, forming an ‘L’ shape.
- Place a 1 x 2 Plate (3023) towards the middle of the 2 x 4 Plate.

#### Step 3: Building the Cabin Base
- Place a 1 x 6 Plate (3666) perpendicular to the front edge of the base, so it extends both to the left and right of the base.

#### Step 4: Creating the Side Walls
- Stack a 2 x 4 Brick (3001) vertically behind the 1 x 4 Plate on the front.
- Attach a 1 x 4 Brick (3010) behind the 2 x 4 Brick.

#### Step 5: Adding Cabin Sides

- Add one 1 x 6 Brick (3009) towards the rear end of the truck base.

#### Step 7: Building the Windshield
- Attach two 2 x 2 Slope Bricks (3039) in place to form the windshield. Lay them towards the front of the base for the angled face.
- Place a Transparent 1 x 2 Plate (3069b) on top of the 1 x 6 Plate to simulate the windows.

#### Step 8: Adding the Roof and Steering
- Attach the Steering Wheel (3829) inside the cabin area.
