For instance, the step "Add some trees, flowers, or other decorations to the yard to create a cozy environment." is very open-ended. The instruction "Attach two 1x2 corner bricks (11211) to the top of the walls to create the roof." is unclear because it doesn’t specify the exact orientation or position.
  - Users might need to re-read and infer placements in multiple steps. 

### 2. Detail (25 points)
- **Score: 18**
  - The instructions cover most of the necessary steps but lack some minor details. For instance, the exact orientation of the pieces is not always clear, and several steps assume user knowledge on how to position pieces without a thorough explanation.
  - Certain steps could be more detailed, like specifying the exact alignment of corner bricks in relation to the base plates.

### 3. Organization (25 points)
- **Score: 11**
  - The organization is moderate but not optimal. Some instructions such as "Add three 1x2x3 doors (60598) to the front of the cottage, centered, to create the entrance." are inconsistent with the pieces list, which indicates only two doors. The progression of steps is not always logical (e.g., adding doors and windows after some walls are already built could be problematic).
  - There could be more consistency, especially in relation to the initial piece list and step descriptions.

### 4. Completeness (15 points)
- **Score: 10**
  - The instruction set is incomplete because it misses several minor steps and pieces (e.g., what to do with the remaining pieces like the classic angular plate, the 1x2 brick, etc.). There are also references to parts not listed in the piece's list (e.g., three doors when only two are listed).
  - Users can still complete the build with some difficulty, but it requires significant guesswork.

### 5. Accessibility (10 points)
- **Score: 6**
  - The instructions are somewhat accessible but might be difficult for beginners due to the lack of clear definitions, images, or diagrams. Intermediate users might manage, but beginners will struggle with the vague descriptions and will need to make significant inferences.
