Story:
Welcome to the Family Home Lego set! This set is designed to create a cozy and inviting home for a family of mini-figures. With its simple yet elegant design, this home is perfect for any Lego city or town.
Step-by-Step Guide:
Step 1:
Start by building the foundation of the house. Place two 2x4 bricks (Part Number: 3001) horizontally, with a small gap in between them. These will serve as the base for the house.
Step 2:
Next, take two 1x2 bricks (Part Number: 3004) and place them vertically on top of the 2x4 bricks, one on each side. These will serve as the front and back walls of the house.
Step 3:
Now, take two 1x4 bricks (Part Number: 3003) and place them horizontally on top of the 1x2 bricks, one on each side. These will serve as the sides of the house.
Step 4:
Take a 1x2 plate with 1 stud (Part Number: 3176) and place it horizontally on top of the 1x4 bricks, in the middle. This will serve as the front door.
Step 5:
Take a 1x2 jumper plate (Part Number: 15573) and place it horizontally on top of the 1x2 plate with 1 stud, in the middle. This will allow for the mini-figure to "open" the door.
Step 6:
Take a 1x2 window (Part Number: 60592) and place it vertically on top of the 1x2 jumper plate. This will serve as the front window of the house.
Step 7:
Take a 2x6 plate (Part Number: 3794) and place it horizontally on top of the 1x2 bricks, in the middle. This will serve as the roof of the house.
Step 8:
Take a 2x4 plate with 2 studs (Part Number: 3795) and place it horizontally on top of the 2x6 plate, in the middle. This will serve as the chimney.
Step 9:
Take a 1x2 plate with 2 studs (Part Number: 3796) and place it horizontally on top of the 2x4 plate with 2 studs. This will allow for the mini-figure to "climb" the chimney.
Step 10:
Take a 1x1 plate (Part Number: 3023) and place it on top of the 1x2 plate with 2 studs. This will serve as the chimney cap.
Step 11:
Take a 2x2 tile (Part Number: 3068) and place it horizontally on top of the 1x4 bricks, on each side. These will serve as the front steps.
Step 12:
Take a 1x4 plate with 2 studs (Part Number: 3410) and place it horizontally on top of the 2x2 tiles, in the middle. This will serve as the front porch.
Step 13:
Take a 1x2 tile (Part Number: 3069) and place it horizontally on top of the 1x4 plate with 2 studs, in the middle. This will serve as the welcome mat.
Step 14:
Take a 1x2 brick (Part Number: 3004) and place it vertically on top of the 1x2 tile, in the middle. This will serve as the front porch railing.
