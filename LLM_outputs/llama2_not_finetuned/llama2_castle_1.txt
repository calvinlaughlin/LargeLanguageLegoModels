Step 1: Building the Base
First, we will build the base of our medieval Castle. We will start by attaching two  x4 base plates together using the special studs on the bottom of each plate. This will give us a solid foundation for our castle (Fig.1).
Figure1. The base plate
Part Number: 8869
Steps: Attach the two baseplates together by lining up the stud on one plate with the groove on another. Hold them together and press down gently until they click into place. Repeat this process for the other two sides. 
Once we have attached all four baseplate together we can start building the walls. Using the 3x3 plate and 6x6 plate, attach them to the sides of base to form the first layer of walls (fig.2)
 Fig. (2). The first wall layer
part number:3243
step: attach the three  by three plate to each side of wall using stud and grove connection. repeat this step for each layer until we reach the desired height of castle wall ( fig.3)  figure (3). Adding the second layer  of  walls
parts needed:  3345
steps: repeat the same process as before, but this time use the six by six plate instead of three by Three. Continue adding layers until the castle is as tall as we want it to be. Once we are done with walls, We can move on to other features such as towers, moat, and drawbridge.
