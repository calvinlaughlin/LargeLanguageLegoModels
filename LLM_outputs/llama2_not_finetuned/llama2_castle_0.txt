Story: Once upon a time, in a far-off kingdom, there lived a brave knight named Sir Edward. He lived in an old castle with his trusty steed and loyal archer, John. One day, a fierce dragon appeared in front of their castle, threatening to destroy it. Sir Edwards and John knew they had to act fast to protect their home. They quickly gathered their weapons and set out to defeat the dragons. With the help of a magical flag, they were able to distract the beast long enough to attack it from behind. After a long battle, the knights emerged victorious, saving the castle and their kingdom from destruction. As they celebrated their victory, their loyal subjects gathered around them, cheering and thanking them for their bravery. From that day on, Sir Edwars and his companions were hailed as heroes, and the kingdom prospered for many years to come.
