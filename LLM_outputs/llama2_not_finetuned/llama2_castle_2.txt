Story: In a far-off kingdom, a brave knight named Sir Edward has been tasked with protecting the kingdom from invading armies. He has built a sturdy hillfortress on a strategic hill to keep watch over the surrounding lands. The hill fort is surrounded by a moat filled with murky water and guarded by drawbridges. Inside, the fort has a great hall for feasts and meetings, as well as private chambers for the knights and their families. In the event of an attack, Sir Edwards can retreat to the safety of his private quarters within the hill. As the sun sets, he stands watch from the ramparts, his trusty sword by his side, ready to defend his kingdom at a moment's notice.  
Step-By-Step Guide:  1) Start by building the base of your hill using plate pieces. Attach two plate  pieces side by side to form a base. Add another plate on top of them to make it thicker. Repeat this process until you have the desired height for your base (step 7).  Step 8: Build the walls of you hill by attaching long bricks sideways to create vertical walls. Use bracket pieces to connect the brics at the top and bottom of each wall. Continue building until your walls are as tall as you want them (Step 9). Step1 0: Add windows and a door to your fort by using the curved window frame and door frame pieces respectively. Place the window frames on the sides of walls and the doorframe on one side of a wall(step11).Step12: Create a drawbridge by connecting two wedge plates together and placing it on hinges so that it can be raised and lowered. (Optional: add a minifgure to serve as the bridge operator) Step thirteen: Finish the roof by placing a series of plate and tile pieces ontop of thw walls, overlapping them slightly for added stability. You can also add additional details such as battlements or a flagpole to complete the look of yor hill top fort. Step fourteen (Final Step): Stand back and admire your finished fort! You have successfully built an impenetrable stronghold that will keep your kingdom safe from any invader. Congratulations, you are now a master builder!
