As a child, I always loved playing with LEGOS. My favorite part was building a car from scratch and making it move. It was like a dream come true when I discovered that I could actually build my own simple cars using real LEGo pieces! I was so excited to share this experience with my little brother, who was just as thrilled to learn that he could build his own car too. We spent hours building and testing our cars, laughing and cheering each other on as we worked together to make them move faster and faster. As we grew older, our interest in building cars with Legos faded, but the memories of those fun times together never did. Now, with the help of this guide, anyone can relive those childhood moments of joy and creativity and create their own fun simple leGO cars!
