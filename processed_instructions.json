        "instructions": "Instructions: Note for helpers: I have broken some of LEGO\u2019s original instructions into smaller steps, but I have kept the original base number. For example, step 5 is now steps 5.1 and 5.2. Side build - Tree branch with flowers. Open bag 1. Open group 1. 1.1. We will start with the base of the branch. Place a green 4x6 half circular plate in front of you, with the flat side at the back. 1.2. Place a dark brown 2x2 circular brick on the back row of the previous piece, centered horizontallyizontally, extending one stud to the back. 2. Place a green 4x6 half circular plate behind the first half circular plate, with the flat side at the front so the two half-circles make an entire circle. 3. Place a dark green 2x2 slope in front of the 2x2 circular brick, centered horizontallyizontally, sloping down to the front. Place another dark green 2x2 slope symmetricallyetrically behind the 2x2 circular brick. Place a dark green 2x2 slope to the left of the 2x2 circular brick, sloping down to the left. Place another dark green 2x2 slope symmetricallyetrically to the right of the 2x2 circular brick. 4. Place a light brown 4x4 circular plate on the previous pieces, centered verticallytically and horizontallyizontally. 5.1. Place a dark brown 2x2 circular plate with four upward arms on the previous piece, centered verticallytically and horizontallyizontally. 5.2. Place a dark brown 2x2 circular brick on the previous piece, centered verticallytically and horizontallyizontally. 6. Now we\u2019ll make the branch a bit taller by adding a trunk. Place a dark brown 2x2 circular brick in front of you and put a light brown 2x2 circular tile with a hole onto it. Rotate this assembly 90 degrees so the circular tile is sideways on the left. 7. Place a dark brown straight axle connector onto one end of a light gray 9L axle. Push the axle through the assembly from step 6 from the left. Push it in until the axle connector touches the circular tile from the previous step. 8.1. Slide the center axle hole of a dark brown 2x2 circular brick onto the right end of the axle until it attaches to the 2x2 circular brick from step 6. 8.2. Slide the center axle hole of a dark brown 2x2 circular plate with four upward arms onto the right end of the axle, with the arms at the left. Push it to the left until it connects to the previous piece. 9.1. Slide another dark brown 2x2 circular brick onto the axle like we did in step 8.1. 9.2. Slide a dark brown 2x2 circular plate onto the axle from the right, until it attaches to the previous piece. 10. Rotate the trunk 90 degrees so the trunk is pointing up and down and the axle connector is at the top. Push the axle through the center of the 2x2 circular brick from step 5, pushing down until it connects to the circular brick from step 5. 11.1. Orient a green 6x5 plant leaves so that the end with only a single stud is at the left, and attach this stud onto the rightmost upward arm on the bottom 2x2 circular plate with four upwards arms. The rest of the plant leaves should extend to the right. A parallel column of two studs should be at the far right. 11.2. Place a dark brown square robot arm onto the far left upward arm on the bottom 2x2 circular plate with four arms. Use the square part of the robot arm to attach it, not the clip. The clip should be up and to the left. Place another dark brown square robot onto the front upward arm on the top 2x2 circular plate with four arms. Use the square part of the arm again, and the clip should be up and to the front. Open group 2. 12. Now we\u2019ll start building a blue and yellow flower, so set the base of the branch aside for now. Place a white 2x2 circular plate with an octagonal bar farm around it in front of you. 13. Place an orange 1x1 circular plate onto each stud of the previous piece so it makes a square of studs. 14.1. Now we\u2019ll make petals! Place a white 1x1 plate with a verticallytical clip on one side in front of you, with the clip on the right. 14.2, Place a yellow 1x2 curved slope tile, horizontallyizontally long, on the previous piece, sloping down to the right, and extending one stud to the left. The cut out should be on the left. 14.3. Attach a petal to each diagonal bar using the clip. The slope tile should be on top. If you draw a line through two opposite petals, it should go through two diagonal corners of the 2x2 square of studs described in step 12. Hinge all the petals down so they lay flat. 15.1. Now we\u2019ll make some larger petals. Place a light blue 1x2 half cylinder slope onto a white 1x2 plate with a verticallytical clip on one long side, with the clip on your left and the slope verticallytically long, sloping up to the left. Repeat this three more times to create a total of four larger petals. 15.2. Keeping the clip at the left, flip a petal overtically so the slope is at the bottom. Attach it to the far right verticallytical bar on the flower. Hinge it 90 degrees counterclockwise so the plate with a clip is at the left and the slope is at the right. Repeat this for each larger petal, keeping the slope on the outside of the flower and the plate with a clip on the inside. Flip the flower overtically so its face is down. 16.1. Place a tan 1x2 plate with a bar on one long side in front of you, horizontallyizontally long, with the bar at the front. 16.2. Place a dark green 2x2 inverticallyted curved slope tile on the bottom of the previous piece, so it slopes up in the back. 16.3. Place a black 2x2 circular plate on the pieces from the previous step. Flip the assembly overtically and attach it to the flower, centered verticallytically and horizontallyizontally. Rotate the flower so its studs are sideways on the left, and the bar from step 16.1 is above the curved tile slope from step 16.2. 17. Set the base of the branch in front of you with the leaf on the right. Attach the bar from step 16.1 to the left robot arm on the branch.The flower should hang down off the branch. Rotate the flower so its face is angled up at about 45 degrees. Open group 3. 18. We\u2019re going to build another flower now. It\u2019s built the same way as the first, but using two shades of pink. Place a white 2x2 circular plate with an octagonal bar farm around it in front of you. 19. Place a yellow 1x1 circular plate with a flower pattern onto each stud of the previous piece so it makes a square of studs. 20.1. Now we\u2019ll make petals! Place a light purple 1x2 curved slope tile onto a white 1x1 plate with a verticallytical clip, with the clip on your right, and the slope horizontallyizontally long, sloping up to the left. Repeat this three more times to create a total of four small petals. 20.2. Attach a petal to each diagonal bar using the clip. The slope tile should be on top. If you draw a line through two opposite petals, it should go through two diagonal corners of the 2x2 square of studs described in step 12. Hinge all the petals down so they lay flat. 21.1. Now we\u2019ll make some larger petals. Place a pink 1x2 half cylinder slope onto a white 1x2 plate with a verticallytical clip on one long side, with the clip on your left and the slope verticallytically long, sloping up to the left. Repeat this three more times to create a total of four larger petals. 21.2. Keeping the clip at the left, flip a petal overtically so the slope is at the bottom. Attach it to the far right verticallytical bar on the flower. Hinge it 90 degrees counterclockwise so the plate with a clip is at the left and the slope is at the right. Repeat this for each larger petal, keeping the slope on the outside of the flower and the plate with a clip on the inside. Flip the flower overtically so its face is down. 22.1. Place a tan 1x2 plate with a bar on one long side in front of you, horizontallyizontally long, with the bar at the front. 22.2. Place a dark green 2x2 inverticallyted curved slope tile on the previous piece, so it slopes up in the back. 22.3. Place a black 2x2 circular plate on the pieces from the previous step. Flip the assembly overtically and attach it to the flower, centered verticallytically and horizontallyizontally. Rotate the flower so its studs are sideways on the left, and the bar from step 16.1 is above the curved tile slope from step 16.2. 23. Set the base of the branch in front of you with the leaf on the right. Attach the bar from step 16.1 to the front robot arm on the branch.The flower should hang down off the branch. Rotate the flower so its face is angled up at about 45 degrees. Open group 4. 24.1. Place a light green 4x3 plant leaves in front of you, horizontallyizontally long. The leaves at the left end should come to a point like a sideways letter V. 24.2. Place two purple 1x1 plates with three leaves on the far right stud, one on top of the other. Place these two pieces so the leaves face away from each other, so they form a flower with six petals. 24.3. Place an orange 1x1 circular plate on the top piece from the previous step. Repeat steps 24.1-24.3 to make another leaf with a flower. 24.4. Attach one leaf with a small flower to the top right upwards bar on the branch, using the stud on the opposite end from the flower, above the 6x5 leaf piece. Attach the other leaf with a small flower to the top back upwards arm. Main build - Pink Parrot: Open group 5. 25.1. Now we\u2019ll start building the parrot! The parrot stands on the branch, and we\u2019ll start with its feet. Push the axle of a blue axle/pin combo into the straight axle connector pointing up at the top of the branch. 25.2. Place a black pin connector with two 2L thin lift-arms on one side down overtically the previous piece, with the lift-arms pointing up. This piece will spin freely. 26.1.

Group 18 contains transparent 1x2 tiles with orange koi fish printed on them, group 19 contains transparent 1x2 tiles with white koi fish printed on them, and group 20 contains light gray 1x1 circular tiles and light gray 1x6 tiles. Now we will start adding the transparent blue tiles and plates which make up the water of the creek. There are koi fish in the stream! We\u2019ll build the water one row at a time, building each row from right to left. For the next few steps, we\u2019ll do things a little bit differently. Because all colors are transparent blue, we won\u2019t tell you which color to grab! All tiles will be placed horizontallyizontally long, so we won\u2019t describe the orientation. 63.1. The first row, from right to left, is two 1x2 tiles, a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile. The right edges of the first 12 rows of the stream are all even. 63.2. The second row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, and a 1x1 plate. 63.3. The third row, from right to left, is a 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish print, a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile. 63.4. The fourth row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish print, a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile. 63.4. The fifth row, from right to left, is a 1x2 tile and a 1x4 tile. 63.5. The sixth row, from right to left, is a 1x4 tile and a 1x2 tile. 63.6. The seventh row is exactly like the fifth row. The eighth row is exactly like the sixth row. The ninth row is another repeat of the fifth row. 63.7. The tenth row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile. Now the orientations start to change. Unless otherwise stated, consider all 1x2 tiles as horizontallyizontal. 64.1. The eleventh row, from right to left, is two 1x2 tiles, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile, and a 1x1 plate. The verticallytical 1x2 tile is even with the back of the other pieces. 64.2. The twelfth row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, a verticallytical 1x2 tile with a koi fish pattern, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, a verticallytical 1x2 tile and a 1x2 tile. The verticallytical tile is even with the back of the other pieces. 64.3. The thirteenth row is offset one stud to the left. This row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, and a 1x1 plate. 64.4. The fourteenth row, from right to left, is a verticallytical 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, and a 1x2 tile. 64.5. The fifteenth row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate between the right two tiles from the fourteenth row, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, and a verticallytical 1x2 tile. 64.6. The sixteenth row is a 1x1 plate between the left two tiles from the fifteenth row. Let\u2019s take a second to check out our stream so far. From right to left, the first six columns should be unbroken columns of twelve, fifteen, fifteen, fifteen, sixteen, and sixteen. The seventh column from the right should have a shorizontallyt column of three at the back and six at the front, with seven exposed studs between. The eighth column should be a partial column with a column of two, then a single. The stream now turns ninety degrees to the left. We\u2019ll start making this turn by working from the twelfth row of the stream, and working towards the front. Because the pieces aren\u2019t nicely horizontallyizontal anymore, we aren\u2019t able to just move in a row from left to right. 65.1. Now we will extend the twelfth row. From right to left, a 1x1 plate, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, and a 1x2 tile. Place a light gray 1x1 circular tile behind the left stud of the last piece of this row. 65.2. Extend the thirteenth row, from right to left, a 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, and a 1x2 tile. 65.3. Extend the fourteenth row, from right to left, a 1x2 tile, skip overtically the flower plate, and a verticallytical 1x2 tile. 65.4. Extend the fifteenth row, from right to left, a 1x2 tile, and a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish pattern. 65.5. Extend the sixteenth row, from right to left, a 1x1 plate, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, and two 1x2 tiles. 65.6. The seventeenth row is a brand new row which starts in front of the right 1x1 from the previous row. From right to left, it is a verticallytical 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, and a 1x2 tile. 65.7. The eighteenth row, from right to left, skip overtically the first tile from the previous step, a 1x1 plate, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile. 65.8. The nineteenth row is offset two studs to the left from the previous row and, from right to left, is a verticallytical 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with a white koi fish pattern, and a verticallytical 1x2 tile. 65.9. The twentieth row is a 1x2 tile between the two verticallytical tiles from the previous step. 65.10. The twenty-first row is two 1x2 tiles. 65.11. The twenty-second row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile. Now let\u2019s take a quick look at how the stream is shaping up. The stream should now have 22 rows, and there should be one row of exposed studs at the front of the base, and one at the back. Row 22 (at the front of the build) should have fourteen exposed studs to the left of it. Row 21 should have thirteen exposed studs to the left of it. Rows 12-15 and row 17 should be even with row 22. Rows 16 and rows 18- 20 should be even with row 21. 66.1. Extend the twenty-second row to the left with three 1x2 tiles. 66.2. Now, we are going to change things up and work from left to right in columns. Almost all of the tiles in these columns will be verticallytically long, so use that orientation unless stated otherwise. First, place a horizontallyizontal 1x2 tile behind the left tile from the previous piece so its left edge is even with the 1x1 flower plate behind it. Extend this column, from front to back, with three 1x2 tiles. The right edges of this column should all be even. 66.3. The next column to the right, from front to back, is three 1x2 tiles, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish, and a 1x2 tile. 66.4. The next column to the right, from front to back, is a horizontallyizontal 1x2 tile, four 1x2 tiles, and a light gray 1x1 circular tile. 66.5. The next column to the right, starting behind the horizontallyizontal tile from the previous step and going from front to back, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, skip overtically the 1x1 flower plate, a horizontallyizontal 1x2 tile, a 1x1 plate, and two horizontallyizontal 1x2 tiles. 66.6. The next column to the right, from front to back, is a 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish, a horizontallyizontal 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, and a horizontallyizontal 1x2 tile. 66.7, Place a 1x2 tile behind the previous piece so the right edges are even. Place another behind the first. Hang on! We\u2019re almost done with the stream! Now, let\u2019s take stock of our creek again. Row 22 should have eight exposed studs to the left of it. Row 21 should only have seven. All of the other rows should be even with row 22. For the next few steps, we will be building columns from left to right. Again, most of the tiles in these columns will be verticallytically long, so use that orientation unless stated otherwise. 67.1. The first column we\u2019ll build is on the second column from the left on the base. From front to back, skipping overtically the front stud on the base, make a column of five 1x2 tiles. The front edges of all subsequent columns will be even with this one. 67.2. The second column, from front to back, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with a white koi fish, two 1x2 tiles, and a horizontallyizontally long light gray 1x6 tile which extends to the right. 67.3. The third column, from front to back, is a 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish, two 1x2 tiles, and a light gray 1x1 circular plate. 67.4. The fourth column, from front to back, is a horizontallyizontal 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile, a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, skip overtically the 1x1 flower plate, and a 1x2 tile. 67.5. The fifth column, from front to back, is four 1x2 tiles behind the tile from the previous step. 67.6. The sixth column, from front to back, is four 1x2 tiles, and a light gray 1x1 circular tile. 67.7. The last column, from front to back, is a 1x1 plate, skip overtically the tile and the 1x1 flower plate, and three 1x2 tiles. There should now be one exposed row of studs to the left of the stream, and one in front of it. The front and left edges of the stream should be unbroken lines of tiles and plates. Open group 21. 68.1. Now we\u2019ll build some water lilies for the stream. Place a green 2x2 dish in front of you, with the stud on top. 68.2. Place a purple five pointed leaf on the previous piece. 68.3. Place an orange 1x1 round tile with verticallytical ribs onto the stud inside the petals of the previous piece. That\u2019s one water lily complete! 68.4. Repeat steps 68.1-68.3 three more times to make a total of four water lilies. 68.5. Now we\u2019ll place the lilies. Starting on the back row of the stream, find the four studs which alternate left and right, with tiles on either side of them. Place one lilly on the second stud from the back. There should be a horizontallyizontal tile to the left and right of this lilly. 68.6. Now, feel straight in front of the previous lilly until you find another stud in the middle of the stream. This is right where the stream starts to turn left. Place a lilly on this stud. There should be a horizontallyizontal tile to the left and right of this lilly. 68.7. To place the next lilly, trace the left side of the verticallytical portion of the stream from back to front until the stream curves, then continue a little ways until you find a stud. Place a lilly on this stud. This should be in front of, and to the left of the previous lilly by a little bit. 68.8. The last lilly is on the front left portion of the stream. Find the two studs on the front row of the stream. Then find the column of two studs between them. Place the last lilly on the front stud. You can use the studs on the edge of the garden for reference. This lilly is on the sixth row from the front, and the fifth column from the left. Now we\u2019ve finished the stream! Open bag 5. Open group 22. 69.1. Now we\u2019ll start building up the garden behind and to the left of the stream.

First, rotate the rock so the side anti-stud is at the bottom, and the previous piece is at the right on the front. Place the garden back in front of you so the stream starts in the middle of the back row and curves to the left. Find the side columns of side studs behind the stream. To the right of the side studs is an exposed 2x2 of studs in the tiles of the stream. Place the 2x2 of anti-stud on the rock onto these studs. Open group 38. 115.1. Time to build another large rock! This one is made in two parts. We\u2019ll build the left part first. Place a light gray 3x3 right sloped wedge brick, with the studs on the back and the wide side at the left, in front of you. 115.2. Place a light gray 2x2 angled slope brick, with the stud at the back left, on the previous piece so the back and left edges are even. 115.3. Now rotate this assembly so the anti-stud is at the back, and the stud from the previous is on the bottom front right corner. Attach it to the leftmost column of side-studs behind the stream. Its left edge should touch the border of the garden base. 115.4. Now we\u2019ll make the right side rock.

Place a red 1x2 plate with a verticallytical clip on one side, with the studs down and the clip at the back, on the back row of anti-stud on the previous piece. Place another symmetricallyetrically in front of the first. Flip the assembly overtically so the tile is on top. 116.6. Repeat steps 116.4 and 116.5 three more times to make four bridge sections. 116.7. Attach the back clip of one bridge section to one of the tube assemblies, immediately to the right of the left bar connector. Attach the other bridge sections to the right of the first. The last one should be immediately to the left of the right bar connector. 116.7. Attach the other tube assembly onto the front clips of the bridge sections. The flat sides of the bar connectors on each end of the tubes should be on the top and bottom. You can rotate these while they\u2019re still attached to the tube. 116.8. Attach a red robot arm with a clip on each side to the front tube between the middle two bridge sections. The elbow of the arm is bent slightly, and the pointed side should point back towards the bridge sections. Repeat this symmetricallyetrically on the back side of the bridge. These will support the bridge railing. 116.9. Now we\u2019ll attach the bridge to the garden. Find the two clips on the left bank of the stream. These are at the verticallyy end of the stepping stone path. Attach the bars on the left side of the bridge to the two clips. Then, attach the other two bars on the bridge to the clips on the right side of the stream. Since the bridge is longer than the stream, you\u2019ll need to bend the tubes so the bridge arches overtically the stream! 117.1. Now we\u2019ll make the bridge rails. Place a red 8L tube, horizontallyizontally long, in front of you. 117.2. Place a red bar connector with a bar on one end, with the bar on the left, on the left end of the previous piece.

Repeat steps 119.1-119.4 six more times to make a total of seven little trees. 119.6. Place one tree on the left column of the garden in front of the frog so there is one exposed stud between it and the frog. 119.7. Place another tree on the left stud in front of the fourth stepping stone from the left of the garden to the left of the stream. This goes on top of the left flower plate in front of this stepping stone. 119.8. Place another tree in front of the left stud of the stepping stone to the left of the bridge, so there is one stud between the tree and the stepping stone. This tree is attached to the front left stud of a 2x2 angled corner plate. 119.9. Now we\u2019ll place two trees in the back right corner of the garden. The first goes on the second column from the right so there are three exposed studs behind it. 119.10. The second goes on the fourth column from the left so there are two exposed studs behind it. The second exposed stud is partially coverticallyed by a 3x3 quarter circle plate. 119.11. Lastly, there are two in the front right corner of the garden. Place one on the third column from the right so there is one exposed stud in front of it. 119.12. Place the last on the fifth row from the right so there are two exposed studs in front of it.

Repeat steps 120.1 and 120.2 three more times until you have a total of four. These are the supports which are in the stream. 120.4. Find the four 1x1 flower plates in the stream on the left side of the garden. The first is on the third column from the left in front of the rocks. The second is on the sixth column from the left between a water lily and a lantern. The third is on the eleventh column from the right behind a lantern. The last one is on the fourteenth column from the left, to the right of a rock. Place one support on each of these 1x1 flower plates. Angle the supports so the flat faces are all parallel with the imaginary lines between the first and second flower plates, and the second, third, and fourth flower plates. 120.4. Now we will place the tall supports for the tea room. The tea room is placed at an angle on single studs. The first four supports will be placed in the stream. The first support goes on the stud which is in the stream behind the far left water lilly. 120.5. The second support goes on the first stud to the right of the front left water lilly. This is between the water lilly and the first lantern. 120.6. Continue to the right of the second support until you find a lantern (if you did not place the lanterns yet this will just be a stud). There should be two studs behind this lantern/stud. Place the third support on the first one. 120.7. Continue behind the second support until you find the stud, then move right. You will find a rock. Find the stud which is just behind and to the right of the rock. Place the last tall support on this stud. 120.5. Find the three 2x2 angled slope bricks behind the stream. The first is on the leftmost column in front of a tree. The second is to the right of the stack of 4x4 tiles with rounded corners. The third is just to the left of the two trees to the left of the bridge. Place a brown 1x1 brick on each of these pieces. 121. Now, rotate the garden 180 degrees so it is horizontallyizontally long and the bridge is closer to the front. Now, we\u2019ll attach the tea room to the support we placed. Place the tea room in front of you, with the entry at the front right. Rotate it so it is in line with the supports from the previous two steps and attach it to them. It should be at close to a 45 degree angle to the rest of the garden. When placed, it should overticallyhang the supports by half a stud on all four sides. Once the tea room is attached, carefully rotate the supports so their flat faces are parallel to the walls of the tea room. The 4x4 tiles with rounded corners should lead up to the entryway like a staircase. Open bag 10. Sub-build 1 - First deciduous tree Open group 43. 122.1.

        "instructions": "Instructions: Open bag 1. Open minifigure group 1. Assemble the Batman minifigure. Start by placing the torso onto the leg piece. The legs are black. The torso is black with a yellow oval with a bat on the front and an orange utility belt across the waist. This belt is where Batman keeps his many useful gadgets! The torso is printed on both the front and back. On the back, you can see a batarang clipped to the back of the utility belt. Place the head on the stud on top of the torso. The face has two sides; one side is a normal face and the other has a pair of white eyes above the normal eyes. These eyes are designed to show through the holes in the Batman mask! If you have a sighted friend helping you build, ask them to make sure the white eyes are at the front. Now place the Batman mask with a cape on the head. Place a black batarang in Batman\u2019s hand to complete the minifigure! Main Build: Open group 1. 1.1. We\u2019ll build the corner of a Gotham City skyscraper for Batman to stand on! The corner of the building is decorated with a small gargoyle. Start by placing a light gray 3x3 plate in front of you. 1.2. Place a black 2x2 brick on the previous piece, even with the back right corner. 2.1. Place a light gray 1x2 inverticallyted slope, with the slope at the front, in front of the right column of the 2x2 brick from the previous step.

Attach them so one point of the triangle is at the back, and one side of the triangle forms a verticallytical line at the front. Once they are attached, hinge them so they angle towards each other. These are the wings of the gargoyle, folded up in a resting position. 12.6. Now, attach the gargoyle to the front left stud on the main build. It should be placed at a 45 degree angle, with the sideways 1x1 circular plate at the front left. 13.1. Now we\u2019ll build the gargoyle\u2019s head! Place a light gray pair of minifigure binoculars in front of you. The binoculars are made up of two bars connected to each other. One end of each bar is thick and hollow. This hollow end can accept a bar. There is a cutout for a stud on one side of the binoculars. Put two silvertically claws, one in each hollow bar on the binoculars. These form the horizontallyns, and the binoculars form the face of the gargoyle. The horizontallyns should curve towards the stud cutout on the binoculars. 13.2. Attach the head assembly to the main build, attaching the cutout on the binoculars to the sideways 1x1 circular plate on the front left of the building, with the horizontallyns pointing up. 14.1.

        "instructions": "Instructions: Minifigure Group 1: Assemble the Harry Potter minifigure by attaching the hair to the head, the head to the stud on the torso, and the torso onto the legs. Place a brown wand in his right hand, and place a coin on his left hand. Harry wears his school uniform of black pants, a gray vest, and a black jacket with red lapels. Under his jacket he wears a white collared shirt and a red tie. He has unruly black hair, and round, thin-rimmed glasses. Sub-build 1: Road Sign Open group 1. 1.1. We\u2019ll start building the sign to Hogwarts! Place a green 4x4 circular plate in front of you. 1.2. Place a dark gray 2x2 circular tile with a single stud on top, on the previous piece, centered verticallytically and horizontallyizontally. 2. Place a green 1x1 plate with three leaves on the leftmost stud of the second row from the back on the 4x4 circular plate, with the leaves pointing left. Place another symmetricallyetrically on the right side of the 4x4 circular plate. 3. Place a white candle upright, with the bar down, into the stud of the 2x2 circular tile with a single stud on top. A candle is a 2L cylinder with a shorizontallyt bar sticking out on one end, and a hole for a bar on the other end. Place another candle on top of the previous candle by sticking its bar into the bar hole of the previous candle. Do this two more times until the sign is four candles tall. 4. Place a black 1x1 circular brick with four upward bars, and one downward bar on the previous piece. Attach it with the downward bar inserted into the hole on top of the top candle. This will be the frame of the lantern on the sign. Rotate this piece so that there is one bar in each cardinal direction: front, back, left, right. These bars will be the attachment points for the signs! 5.1. Now let\u2019s put the light in the lantern! Place a transparent yellow 1x1 circular brick onto the stud in the center of the previous piece. 5.2. Place a black 1x1 circular tile on the previous piece. 6.1. Now we\u2019ll make a sign board for Hogsmeade. Place a white 1x2 plate with a verticallytical clip on the shorizontallyt side, horizontallyizontally long, in front of you with the clip on the left. 6.2. Place a white 1x3 tile with a \u201cHOGSMEADE\u201d sticker, horizontallyizontally long, on the previous piece, overticallyhanging one stud to the right. 6.3. Place a white 1x1 plate with a horizontallyizontal tooth on one side, horizontallyizontally long, under the right stud of the previous piece, with the tooth at the right. 6.4. Attach the clip to the right bar on the lantern so the sign extends horizontallyizontally to the right, with the tooth pointing right like an arrow. The \u201cHOGSMEADE\u201d sticker should be at the front. Open group 2. 7.1. Now it\u2019s time to make the sign for Hogwarts, which is in the opposite direction. Place a white 1x2 plate with a verticallytical clip on the shorizontallyt side, horizontallyizontally long, in front of you with the clip on the right. 7.2. Place a white 1x3 tile with a \u201cHOGWARTS\u201d sticker, horizontallyizontally long, on the previous piece, overticallyhanging one stud to the left. 7.3. Place a white 1x1 plate with a horizontallyizontal tooth on one side, horizontallyizontally long, under the left stud of the previous piece, with the tooth at the left. 7.4. Attach the clip to the left bar on the lantern so the sign extends horizontallyizontally to the left, with the tooth pointing right like an arrow. The \u201cHOGWARTS\u201d sticker should be at the front. Excellent! Main-Build 1: Steam Locomotive Open group 3. 1.1. Any train needs a locomotive! The Hogwarts Express is pulled by a bright red and black steam engine! Let\u2019s start putting it together. Find a dark gray 1x14 brick with pin-holes on the side, and place it horizontallyizontally long in front of you. 1.2. Place a black 2L pin into the leftmost and rightmost holes on the side of the previous piece, pushing them in from the front. 2. Place another 1x14 brick with pin-holes on the side, horizontallyizontally long, onto the pins from the previous step so that you now have a 2x14 brick. This is the frame of the locomotive! 3.1. Place a light gray 1x10 brick with pin-holes on the side, and place it horizontallyizontally long in front of you. 3.2. Place a tan axle/pin combo into the leftmost, center, and rightmost pin-holes from the front, so the axle extends to the front. There should be three holes between each axle. 3.3. Place a black pin into the second pin-hole from the left, pushing it in from the back. Place another into the second pin-hole from the right, again pushing it in from the back. 3.4. Use the black pins to attach the 1x10 brick with pin-holes to the front of the frame, lining up the left ends. The frame should extend four studs past the end of the 1x10 brick. 3.5. Repeat steps 3.1-3.3, and attach it symmetricallyetrically to the back side of the frame. There should now be three axles extending on the front and back sides of the frame. These will hold the main driving wheels for the locomotive! Keeping the 1x10 bricks and the left, and the frame horizontallyizontally long, flip the frame overtically so the studs are down. 4.1. Place a dark gray 2x4 plate, verticallytically long, on the left two columns of anti-stud. \u201cAnti-stud\u201d is a term for the portion of a LEGO piece which accepts studs, like the bottom of a plate. Place another, verticallytically long, on the right two columns of anti-stud on the 1x10 bricks, so there are four exposed columns of antistud to the right. 4.2. Place a light gray 2x2 circular plate on the right two columns of anti-stud. Flip the frame back overtically into its original configuration, horizontallyizontally long, with the previous piece at the right on the bottom. 5.1. Place a dark gray 2x3 plate with one rounded end with a hole in it, horizontallyizontally long, on the right two columns, so the rounded end overticallyhangs to the right. This will be used later to attach the tender to the engine! The tender is the small car that carries the locomotive\u2019s fuel (coal or oil) and water! 5.2. Place an orange 2x2 brick on the previous piece, even with the left end. 6.1. Place a black 1x12 brick, horizontallyizontally long, in front of, and aligned with the right end of the 2x2 brick from the previous step. Place another symmetricallyetrically behind the 2x2 brick from the previous step. 6.2. Place a dark gray 1x12 plate, horizontallyizontally long, on each of the previous pieces. 7.1. Place a light blue 2x2 plate on the two leftmost columns of the frame, centered verticallytically. 7.2. Place a dark gray 2x3 plate with one rounded end with a hole in it, horizontallyizontally long, on the previous piece, so the rounded end overticallyhangs to the left. 7.3. Place a light blue 2x2 plate on the previous piece. Open group 4. 8.1. Place a light gray 2L pin into the hole of the left 2x3 plate with one rounded end with a hole in it, from the bottom. Push it up until it hits the stop. 8.2. Push one hole of a red 2L thick liftarm onto the previous piece from the bottom, so it extends to the front. 8.3. Push a light gray 2L pin into the previous piece from the bottom. This assembly will allow the front wheels of the train to rotate when the train moves around curves on the track! 9.1. Now we\u2019ll start building the top of the bogie for the front wheels. A bogie is a frame which holds the wheels of a train. On a real train, it can rotate and pivot so the train can go around curves without tipping overtically! On this train, you\u2019ll be able to lock it in place, or to let it move freely. We\u2019ll start by placing a black 4x4 plate in front of you. 9.2. Place a dark gray 2x3 plate with one rounded end with a hole in it, horizontallyizontally long, centered verticallytically, on the previous piece, so the rounded end overticallyhangs to the right. 9.3. Place an orange 1x2 plate, verticallytically long, to the left of the previous piece. 9.4. Place a light orange 1x2 plate with a verticallytical clip on one long side, horizontallyizontally long, to the left of the previous piece with the clip on the left. The middle rows of the 4x4 plate should be one plate higher than the front and back rows. 9.4. Place a black 2x2 curved slope tile, with the cut out on the front middle row, on the front two rows of the 4x4, even with the left edge. It should slope down to the front. Place another to the right of the first. Place two more symmetricallyetrically behind the first two. The top of the bogie should gently curve down from the middle rows. 9.5. With the clip at the left, push the hole in the 2x3 plate with one rounded end onto the pin at the far left of the frame, pushing it up from the bottom. 10.1. Now we\u2019re going to extend the frame. Place a dark gray 2x4 plate verticallytically long in front of you. 10.2. Place a black 1x6 brick with pin-holes on the side, horizontallyizontally long, on the front row of the previous piece, with the left end aligned with the left end of the previous piece. Place another black 1x6 brick with pin-holes on the side, symmetricallyetrically on the back row of the 2x4 plate. 10.3. Place an orange 2x2 brick on the 2x4 plate, between the two previous pieces. 10.4. Place a dark gray 2x4 plate, verticallytically long, on the right two columns of the 1x6 bricks so it extends across both. 10.5. Place a silvertically 1x1 circular plate to the left of the front and back rows of the previous plate. 10.6. Place a dark gray 1L pin into each of the left two pin-holes on the front 1x6 brick. Push them in from the front, so the shorizontallyt ends of the pins become side studs. Repeat this symmetricallyetrically on the back 1x6 brick. 10.7. Place this on the frame, horizontallyizontally long, to the left of the 1x12 bricks on the frame, with the top 2x4 plate at the right. The bogie should extend two studs to the left of this assembly. Open group 5. 11.1. Place a light blue 1x4 plate, horizontallyizontally long, on the front row of the frame, skipping three studs from the right end. 11.2. Place a red 2x2 tile with two studs on top, to the left of the previous piece, so it overticallyhangs one stud to the front, and so the studs are in line with the studs from the previous piece. Place another to the left of the first. 11.3. Place a light blue 1x4 plate, horizontallyizontally long, to the left of the previous piece. Its left end should be on the silvertically 1x1 circular plate. 11.4. Repeat steps 11.1-11.3 symmetricallyetrically on the back row of the frame. 12.1. Place a dark gray 2x4 plate, verticallytically long, on the right two columns of the frame. 12.2. Place a light blue 1x4 plate, verticallytically long, to the left of the previous piece. 13. Place a black 2x6 plate, verticallytically long and centered verticallytically, on the second and third columns from the left of the frame. Open group 6. 14.1. Now we\u2019re going to build the front of the frame! Place a black 1x2 plate with a 2x2 of studs hanging down one side in front of you, with the side studs at the left. 14.2. Place a black 1x2 concave slope sideways on the back, upwards column of the previous piece, with the brick at the bottom and the narrow edge at the top. Place another on the front, upwards column. 14.3. Keeping this orientation, attach this to the leftmost studs on the frame, centered verticallytically. Its top should be even with the 2x6 plate from step 13, and it should extend to the left overtically the bogie. 14.4. Repeat steps 14.1 and 14.2 two more times, and place the created assemblies one in front, and one behind, the first one. The last two assemblies should only be connected by one stud. There should be a row of six side studs at the left of the frame. Open group 7. 15.1. Place a black 2x6 plate, horizontallyizontally long and centered verticallytically, on the frame, with its left stud on the leftmost upwards stud on the frame. 15.2. Place a black 2x3 plate, horizontallyizontally long, on the previous piece, even with the left edge. 16. Place a black 1x2 wide slope tile in front of the previous two pieces, even with the left edge of the previous piece, with the thick edge at the back. Place another symmetricallyetrically on the back side of the frame. 17. Place a black 1x3 jumper plate sideways on the front three side studs at the left end of the frame. A jumper plate is a 1x2 plate with a single stud on top, or a 1x3 plate with only two studs on top. Place another behind the first, so the six studs pointing sideways at the front of the frame are now just four. Open group 8. 18.1. Now we\u2019ll build the locomotive\u2019s bumper! Place a black 1x6 plate, horizontallyizontally long, in front of you. 18.2. Place a black 1x2 plate with a parallel bar on the long side, horizontallyizontally long and centered horizontallyizontally, on the previous piece, with the bar at the back. 18.3. Place a black 1x2 plate with a perpendicular bar on the long side, horizontallyizontally long, to the left of the previous piece, with the peg at the front. Place another symmetricallyetrically at the right. 18.4. Place a red 1x3 jumper plate, horizontallyizontally long, on the right three studs. Place another to the left of the first, so the six studs on top become four studs. 18.5. Place a silvertically 1x1 circular plate on the leftmost stud of the previous piece. Place another on the rightmost stud of the other 1x3 jumper plate. 18.6. Place a black 1x1 circular tile on each of the previous two pieces. Rotate the bumper assembly so the bar is at the right, and the circular tiles are at the bottom. 18.7. Attach the bar to the clip at the left end of the bogie. Then hinge the bumper clockwise 90 degrees until it attaches to the four side studs at the left side of the train. Keeping the bumper at the left, flip the train overtically so the studs point down. 19. Now we\u2019ll start attaching the wheels to the train. We\u2019ll start with the driving wheels. These are the large wheels which actually move the train forward. Place a large train wheel with a flange on the front left axle, with the flange against the frame. The flange is the raised portion on the edge of the wheel. This sits inside of the rails and prevents the train from derailing! Place another large wheel with a flange on the right axle. Place two more symmetricallyetrically on the back side of the frame. 20. Place a large wheel without a flange on the middle axle on the front of the frame, and another on the middle axle of the back of the frame. The flat side of the wheels should be on the outward side of the locomotive. 21.1. Now we\u2019ll put the wheels on the bogie! Place a black 1x4 plate with a peg on each shorizontallyt end, verticallytically long, in front of you. 21.2. Place a small train wheel on each peg, with the flange against the plate. 21.3. Place this assembly, verticallytically long, on the left column of anti-stud on the bogie. 21.4.

Rotate the macaroni tile so it arches to the left overtically the center driving wheel like a rainbow. The left and right ends should be level with each other. Now the locomotive is complete! To allow the train to go onto curved rails, it is important to allow the bogie holding the front wheels to move. To do this, hinge the bumper down and away from the body of the locomotive until it disconnects from the studs. Then pull the bar off of the clip under the locomotive. With the bumper removed, flip it overtically so the pegs are now at the bottom and the bar is on top. Reconnect it to the studs. The clip on the bogie should go between the studs so they restrict it from moving too far! Now the bogie can rotate, allowing the locomotive to navigate turns! You can undo what we just did by performing the reverticallyse, which will lock the bogie in the forward position! Open bag 3. Open minifigure group 3. Assemble the conductor minifigure by attaching the hat to the head, the head to the bar on top of the torso, and the torso to the legs! The conductor wears a burgundy hat, pants, vest, and jacket.

Attach the sign assembly, horizontallyizontally long, with the flowers at the front, on the back two rows on the platform extension to the left of the station. Open group 45. 74. Now we will make some tracks! LEGO train tracks are completely plastic. They have 2x8 plates running perpendicular to the rails which represent railroad ties. A straight section has three full ties and two half ties. The half ties are at each end of the track section, and are where the track sections are attached together. The best way to attach them is to place two pieces of track next to each other on a flat surface and align the half ties of the two pieces, then push them together. For the track in front of the station, go ahead and place two straight pieces of track horizontallyizontally long in front of you. Push the two tracks together until they snap. 75.1. Attach a dark gray 8x12 railroad ramp onto the left of the train tracks. Attach it, horizontallyizontally long, to the left of the previous pieces, with the flat portion at the left. 75.2. Now we\u2019ll decorate the rails a bit using two green 1x1 circular plates with a flower pattern, and two dark tan 1x1 quarter circle tiles. Just like the leaves on the roof, this is up to your imagination, just keep the back row of studs on the fourth and sixth ties from the left clear! The instructions have a flower plate on the second and sixth ties from the left. They also have a quarter circle tile on the third and eighth tie from the left. 76. Attach the fourth and sixth ties from the left onto the two slopes which extend from the front of the train platform. The rails should run parallel to the platform. 77. Attach two more dark gray straight track pieces to the right of the section attached to the station. 78. Attach a dark gray 8x12 railroad ramp onto the previous pieces, with the ramp at the right. 79. Finish up by decorating this section of track like we did with the first section! Once again we\u2019ll use two green 1x1 circular plates with a flower pattern, and two dark tan 1x1 quarter circle tiles. The instructions show a flower plate on the fourth and sixth tie from the right, and a quarter circle tiles on the second and eighth ties from the right. Congratulations! Now Hogwarts Express and Hogsmeade Station are complete! The students can sit in the train cars! Unfortunately, their legs don\u2019t bend, so they stand in the seats. The trolley witch can stand next to her cart. You can drive the train on the floor and drive it up the ramp to have it pull into the station! If you have LEGO trains, this train will fit on the same tracks! Thank you",

We\u2019ll start building the sign to Hogwarts! Place a green 4x4 circular plate in front of you. 1.2. Place a dark gray 2x2 circular tile with a single stud on top, on the previous piece, centered verticallytically and horizontallyizontally. 2. Place a green 1x1 plate with three leaves on the leftmost stud of the second row from the back on the 4x4 circular plate, with the leaves pointing left. Place another symmetricallyetrically on the right side of the 4x4 circular plate. 3. Place a white candle upright, with the bar down, into the stud of the 2x2 circular tile with a single stud on top. A candle is a 2L cylinder with a shorizontallyt bar sticking out on one end, and a hole for a bar on the other end. Place another candle on top of the previous candle by sticking its bar into the bar hole of the previous candle. Do this two more times until the sign is four candles tall. 4. Place a black 1x1 circular brick with four upward bars, and one downward bar on the previous piece. Attach it with the downward bar inserted into the hole on top of the top candle. This will be the frame of the lantern on the sign. Rotate this piece so that there is one bar in each cardinal direction: front, back, left, right. These bars will be the attachment points for the signs! 5.1. Now let\u2019s put the light in the lantern! Place a transparent yellow 1x1 circular brick onto the stud in the center of the previous piece. 5.2. Place a black 1x1 circular tile on the previous piece. 6.1. Now we\u2019ll make a sign board for Hogsmeade.

Attach the clip to the left bar on the lantern so the sign extends horizontallyizontally to the left, with the tooth pointing right like an arrow. The \u201cHOGWARTS\u201d sticker should be at the front. Excellent! Main-Build 1: Steam Locomotive Open group 3. 1.1. Any train needs a locomotive! The Hogwarts Express is pulled by a bright red and black steam engine! Let\u2019s start putting it together. Find a dark gray 1x14 brick with pin-holes on the side, and place it horizontallyizontally long in front of you. 1.2. Place a black 2L pin into the leftmost and rightmost holes on the side of the previous piece, pushing them in from the front. 2. Place another 1x14 brick with pin-holes on the side, horizontallyizontally long, onto the pins from the previous step so that you now have a 2x14 brick. This is the frame of the locomotive! 3.1. Place a light gray 1x10 brick with pin-holes on the side, and place it horizontallyizontally long in front of you. 3.2. Place a tan axle/pin combo into the leftmost, center, and rightmost pin-holes from the front, so the axle extends to the front. There should be three holes between each axle. 3.3. Place a black pin into the second pin-hole from the left, pushing it in from the back. Place another into the second pin-hole from the right, again pushing it in from the back. 3.4. Use the black pins to attach the 1x10 brick with pin-holes to the front of the frame, lining up the left ends. The frame should extend four studs past the end of the 1x10 brick. 3.5. Repeat steps 3.1-3.3, and attach it symmetricallyetrically to the back side of the frame. There should now be three axles extending on the front and back sides of the frame. These will hold the main driving wheels for the locomotive! Keeping the 1x10 bricks and the left, and the frame horizontallyizontally long, flip the frame overtically so the studs are down. 4.1. Place a dark gray 2x4 plate, verticallytically long, on the left two columns of anti-stud. \u201cAnti-stud\u201d is a term for the portion of a LEGO piece which accepts studs, like the bottom of a plate. Place another, verticallytically long, on the right two columns of anti-stud on the 1x10 bricks, so there are four exposed columns of antistud to the right. 4.2. Place a light gray 2x2 circular plate on the right two columns of anti-stud. Flip the frame back overtically into its original configuration, horizontallyizontally long, with the previous piece at the right on the bottom. 5.1. Place a dark gray 2x3 plate with one rounded end with a hole in it, horizontallyizontally long, on the right two columns, so the rounded end overticallyhangs to the right. This will be used later to attach the tender to the engine! The tender is the small car that carries the locomotive\u2019s fuel (coal or oil) and water! 5.2. Place an orange 2x2 brick on the previous piece, even with the left end. 6.1. Place a black 1x12 brick, horizontallyizontally long, in front of, and aligned with the right end of the 2x2 brick from the previous step. Place another symmetricallyetrically behind the 2x2 brick from the previous step. 6.2. Place a dark gray 1x12 plate, horizontallyizontally long, on each of the previous pieces. 7.1. Place a light blue 2x2 plate on the two leftmost columns of the frame, centered verticallytically. 7.2. Place a dark gray 2x3 plate with one rounded end with a hole in it, horizontallyizontally long, on the previous piece, so the rounded end overticallyhangs to the left. 7.3. Place a light blue 2x2 plate on the previous piece. Open group 4. 8.1. Place a light gray 2L pin into the hole of the left 2x3 plate with one rounded end with a hole in it, from the bottom. Push it up until it hits the stop. 8.2. Push one hole of a red 2L thick liftarm onto the previous piece from the bottom, so it extends to the front. 8.3. Push a light gray 2L pin into the previous piece from the bottom. This assembly will allow the front wheels of the train to rotate when the train moves around curves on the track! 9.1. Now we\u2019ll start building the top of the bogie for the front wheels. A bogie is a frame which holds the wheels of a train. On a real train, it can rotate and pivot so the train can go around curves without tipping overtically! On this train, you\u2019ll be able to lock it in place, or to let it move freely. We\u2019ll start by placing a black 4x4 plate in front of you. 9.2. Place a dark gray 2x3 plate with one rounded end with a hole in it, horizontallyizontally long, centered verticallytically, on the previous piece, so the rounded end overticallyhangs to the right. 9.3. Place an orange 1x2 plate, verticallytically long, to the left of the previous piece. 9.4. Place a light orange 1x2 plate with a verticallytical clip on one long side, horizontallyizontally long, to the left of the previous piece with the clip on the left. The middle rows of the 4x4 plate should be one plate higher than the front and back rows. 9.4. Place a black 2x2 curved slope tile, with the cut out on the front middle row, on the front two rows of the 4x4, even with the left edge. It should slope down to the front. Place another to the right of the first. Place two more symmetricallyetrically behind the first two. The top of the bogie should gently curve down from the middle rows. 9.5. With the clip at the left, push the hole in the 2x3 plate with one rounded end onto the pin at the far left of the frame, pushing it up from the bottom. 10.1. Now we\u2019re going to extend the frame. Place a dark gray 2x4 plate verticallytically long in front of you. 10.2. Place a black 1x6 brick with pin-holes on the side, horizontallyizontally long, on the front row of the previous piece, with the left end aligned with the left end of the previous piece. Place another black 1x6 brick with pin-holes on the side, symmetricallyetrically on the back row of the 2x4 plate. 10.3. Place an orange 2x2 brick on the 2x4 plate, between the two previous pieces. 10.4. Place a dark gray 2x4 plate, verticallytically long, on the right two columns of the 1x6 bricks so it extends across both. 10.5. Place a silvertically 1x1 circular plate to the left of the front and back rows of the previous plate. 10.6. Place a dark gray 1L pin into each of the left two pin-holes on the front 1x6 brick. Push them in from the front, so the shorizontallyt ends of the pins become side studs. Repeat this symmetricallyetrically on the back 1x6 brick. 10.7. Place this on the frame, horizontallyizontally long, to the left of the 1x12 bricks on the frame, with the top 2x4 plate at the right. The bogie should extend two studs to the left of this assembly. Open group 5. 11.1. Place a light blue 1x4 plate, horizontallyizontally long, on the front row of the frame, skipping three studs from the right end. 11.2. Place a red 2x2 tile with two studs on top, to the left of the previous piece, so it overticallyhangs one stud to the front, and so the studs are in line with the studs from the previous piece. Place another to the left of the first. 11.3. Place a light blue 1x4 plate, horizontallyizontally long, to the left of the previous piece. Its left end should be on the silvertically 1x1 circular plate. 11.4. Repeat steps 11.1-11.3 symmetricallyetrically on the back row of the frame. 12.1. Place a dark gray 2x4 plate, verticallytically long, on the right two columns of the frame. 12.2. Place a light blue 1x4 plate, verticallytically long, to the left of the previous piece. 13. Place a black 2x6 plate, verticallytically long and centered verticallytically, on the second and third columns from the left of the frame. Open group 6. 14.1. Now we\u2019re going to build the front of the frame! Place a black 1x2 plate with a 2x2 of studs hanging down one side in front of you, with the side studs at the left. 14.2. Place a black 1x2 concave slope sideways on the back, upwards column of the previous piece, with the brick at the bottom and the narrow edge at the top. Place another on the front, upwards column. 14.3. Keeping this orientation, attach this to the leftmost studs on the frame, centered verticallytically. Its top should be even with the 2x6 plate from step 13, and it should extend to the left overtically the bogie. 14.4. Repeat steps 14.1 and 14.2 two more times, and place the created assemblies one in front, and one behind, the first one. The last two assemblies should only be connected by one stud. There should be a row of six side studs at the left of the frame. Open group 7. 15.1. Place a black 2x6 plate, horizontallyizontally long and centered verticallytically, on the frame, with its left stud on the leftmost upwards stud on the frame. 15.2. Place a black 2x3 plate, horizontallyizontally long, on the previous piece, even with the left edge. 16. Place a black 1x2 wide slope tile in front of the previous two pieces, even with the left edge of the previous piece, with the thick edge at the back. Place another symmetricallyetrically on the back side of the frame. 17. Place a black 1x3 jumper plate sideways on the front three side studs at the left end of the frame. A jumper plate is a 1x2 plate with a single stud on top, or a 1x3 plate with only two studs on top. Place another behind the first, so the six studs pointing sideways at the front of the frame are now just four. Open group 8. 18.1. Now we\u2019ll build the locomotive\u2019s bumper! Place a black 1x6 plate, horizontallyizontally long, in front of you. 18.2. Place a black 1x2 plate with a parallel bar on the long side, horizontallyizontally long and centered horizontallyizontally, on the previous piece, with the bar at the back. 18.3. Place a black 1x2 plate with a perpendicular bar on the long side, horizontallyizontally long, to the left of the previous piece, with the peg at the front. Place another symmetricallyetrically at the right. 18.4. Place a red 1x3 jumper plate, horizontallyizontally long, on the right three studs. Place another to the left of the first, so the six studs on top become four studs. 18.5. Place a silvertically 1x1 circular plate on the leftmost stud of the previous piece. Place another on the rightmost stud of the other 1x3 jumper plate. 18.6. Place a black 1x1 circular tile on each of the previous two pieces. Rotate the bumper assembly so the bar is at the right, and the circular tiles are at the bottom. 18.7. Attach the bar to the clip at the left end of the bogie. Then hinge the bumper clockwise 90 degrees until it attaches to the four side studs at the left side of the train. Keeping the bumper at the left, flip the train overtically so the studs point down. 19. Now we\u2019ll start attaching the wheels to the train. We\u2019ll start with the driving wheels. These are the large wheels which actually move the train forward. Place a large train wheel with a flange on the front left axle, with the flange against the frame. The flange is the raised portion on the edge of the wheel. This sits inside of the rails and prevents the train from derailing! Place another large wheel with a flange on the right axle. Place two more symmetricallyetrically on the back side of the frame. 20. Place a large wheel without a flange on the middle axle on the front of the frame, and another on the middle axle of the back of the frame. The flat side of the wheels should be on the outward side of the locomotive. 21.1. Now we\u2019ll put the wheels on the bogie! Place a black 1x4 plate with a peg on each shorizontallyt end, verticallytically long, in front of you. 21.2. Place a small train wheel on each peg, with the flange against the plate. 21.3. Place this assembly, verticallytically long, on the left column of anti-stud on the bogie. 21.4. Repeat steps 21.1 and 21.2 and place this, verticallytically long, on the right column of anti-stud on the bogie. Flip the train overtically so the bumper is at the right and the studs are up. Open group 9. 22. Place a red 4x6 plate with a slope on each shorizontallyt end, verticallytically long, on the left side of the frame, with its left edge on the fourth column from the right. The right side of the plate should touch two 2x2 tiles with two studs on one side. Place another red 4x6 plate with a slope on each shorizontallyt end, verticallytically long, four studs to the right of the first one. Its right end should touch a 2x3 plate, and its left end should touch two 2x2 tiles with two studs on one side. Now the locomotive is starting to gain some color! 23.1. Now we\u2019ll build the steam chest and piston rod for the left side of the locomotive. Find a black 2L thick liftarm with a bar extending at 45 degrees from one side. Place it horizontallyizontally long in front of you, with the bar at the right pointing to the back. 23.2. Place a black 2L pin through the right pin-hole from the top. 23.3. Place another black 2L thick liftarm with a bar extending at 45 degrees from one side onto the previous piece, so it is in the same orientation as the first one. 23.4. Place a dark gray 1L pin into the left hole of the top liftarm, pushing it down from the top. Place another into the left hole of the bottom liftarm, pushing it in from the bottom. 23.5. Push a light gray 6L bar with a stop, through the pins from the previous step, down through the top pin, with the stop on top, until it is even with the bottom of the bottom pin. Rotate the assembly so the previous piece points left, and the angled bars on the lift-arms are at the back. 23.6. Place a black 1x1 circular tile on the side stud on the bottom right. 23.7. Attach the two angled bars into the two side studs on the front of the frame, directly above the leftmost wheel on the bogie. The lift-arms should be sloped down towards the front, and the 6L bar should extend overtically the driving wheel. Keeping the studs up, rotate the locomotive so the bumper is now on the left. 24.1. It\u2019s time to build this assembly on the other side of the locomotive. Find a black 2L thick liftarm with a bar extending at 45 degrees from one side. Place it horizontallyizontally long in front of you, with the bar at the left pointing to the back. 24.2. Place a black 2L pin through the left pin-hole from the top. 24.3. Place another black 2L thick liftarm with a bar extending at 45 degrees from one side onto the previous piece, so it is in the same orientation as the first one. 24.4. Place a dark gray 1L pin into the right hole of the top lift-arm, pushing it down from the top. Place another into the right hole of the bottom lift-arm, pushing it in from the bottom. 24.5. Push a light gray 6L bar with a stop, through the pins from the previous step, down through the top pin, with the stop on top, until it is even with the bottom of the bottom pin. Rotate the assembly so the previous piece points right, and the angled bars on the lift-arms are at the back. 24.6. Place a black 1x1 circular tile on the side stud on the bottom left. 24.7. Attach the two angled bars into the two side studs on the front of the frame, directly above the leftmost wheel on the bogie. The lift arms should be sloped down towards the front, and the 6L bar should extend to the right overtically the driving wheel. Open bag 2. Minifigure Group 2: Assemble the Hermione Granger minifigure by attaching the hair to the head, the head to the stud on the torso, and the torso onto the legs, placing her skirt between the torso and legs.

Under her jacket she also wears a white collared shirt and a red tie. Hermione has long brown hair and a confident smile Main-Build 1: Steam Locomotive Continued Open group 10. 25.1. Now we\u2019ll start building up the locomotive! Find the two 1x4 rows of studs between the 4x6 plates with slopes on each end. These rows are above the middle driving wheel. Place a dark red 1x1 brick with a stud on one side, on the rightmost stud in the front 1x4 row, with the stud at the front. Place another symmetricallyetrically on the back 1x4 row. 25.2. Place a red 3x4 tile with a row of 1x4 studs on top, verticallytically long and centered verticallytically, to the left of the previous pieces. 26.1. Place a dark red 1x6 tile, horizontallyizontally long, to the left of each of the 1x1 bricks with a side stud we just placed. 26.2. Place a dark red 1x2 slope with a cutout and no stud on top, to the left of each of the previous pieces, sloping down to the left. The cut out should be on a 4x6 plate with a slope on two sides, and the bottom of the piece should be to the right of a 1x2 slope tile. 27.1. Now we\u2019re going to make the fire in the firebox! This is where the engineer can add fuel to the fire which heats water into steam to power the locomotive! Place a transparent orange 1x1 slope tile on the third stud from the right end of the locomotive, on the second stud from the front, with the thick end at the left. Place another behind it, with the thick end at the front. There should be two exposed studs to the right of these pieces. 27.2. Place a light gray 1x1 plate with a stud hanging down from one side behind the previous piece, with the side stud at the back. Place another symmetricallyetrically on the front row. 28.

Rotate the macaroni tile so it arches to the left overtically the center driving wheel like a rainbow. The left and right ends should be level with each other. Now the locomotive is complete! To allow the train to go onto curved rails, it is important to allow the bogie holding the front wheels to move. To do this, hinge the bumper down and away from the body of the locomotive until it disconnects from the studs. Then pull the bar off of the clip under the locomotive. With the bumper removed, flip it overtically so the pegs are now at the bottom and the bar is on top. Reconnect it to the studs. The clip on the bogie should go between the studs so they restrict it from moving too far! Now the bogie can rotate, allowing the locomotive to navigate turns! You can undo what we just did by performing the reverticallyse, which will lock the bogie in the forward position! Open bag 3. Open minifigure group 3. Assemble the conductor minifigure by attaching the hat to the head, the head to the bar on top of the torso, and the torso to the legs! The conductor wears a burgundy hat, pants, vest, and jacket.

Now we\u2019ll decorate the rails a bit using two green 1x1 circular plates with a flower pattern, and two dark tan 1x1 quarter circle tiles. Just like the leaves on the roof, this is up to your imagination, just keep the back row of studs on the fourth and sixth ties from the left clear! The instructions have a flower plate on the second and sixth ties from the left. They also have a quarter circle tile on the third and eighth tie from the left. 76. Attach the fourth and sixth ties from the left onto the two slopes which extend from the front of the train platform. The rails should run parallel to the platform. 77. Attach two more dark gray straight track pieces to the right of the section attached to the station. 78. Attach a dark gray 8x12 railroad ramp onto the previous pieces, with the ramp at the right. 79. Finish up by decorating this section of track like we did with the first section! Once again we\u2019ll use two green 1x1 circular plates with a flower pattern, and two dark tan 1x1 quarter circle tiles. The instructions show a flower plate on the fourth and sixth tie from the right, and a quarter circle tiles on the second and eighth ties from the right. Congratulations! Now Hogwarts Express and Hogsmeade Station are complete! The students can sit in the train cars! Unfortunately, their legs don\u2019t bend, so they stand in the seats. The trolley witch can stand next to her cart. You can drive the train on the floor and drive it up the ramp to have it pull into the station! If you have LEGO trains, this train will fit on the same tracks! Thank you",

Locate a white cloud with three studs and bumpy edges, one transparent 2x2 cylinder, one pink teapot, two pink flowers with bumpy sides and a stud on top, one brown 1x1 circular tile with a printed cookie, and one transparent tea cup with a handle and orange tea inside. Start by placing the cloud, centered, on top of the cylinder. Then on the three studs from left to right, place the teapot, then the cookie, then the teacup. Now, place the pink flower underneath and on top of the teapot to act as a fancy base and a lid! 91. Now diagonally place the cloud table on the front stud of the 2x4 plate on the floor with only two studs. The side of the cloud table with the teapot should be facing the bed. 92. Let\u2019s build a vine of more flowers and leaves to finish off! Locate one green vine with 6 studs, one red flower with a stem, and one leaf piece with three spikes. Orient the vine so the longest stem is facing right and the stud with ridged edges is facing left. Place the red flower into the left stud and the leaf piece onto the right stud with the spikes facing right. Now horizontallyizontally, in the same orientation, place the vine on top of the two studs on the ceiling. This is the highest piece of the build. 93. Two more vines to go! Locate another green vine with 6 studs (specifically 2 large, 4 small), then locate one pink flower with a stud, and one red flower with a stem. Orient the vine so the longest stem is facing left and the ridged stud is facing right. Place the pink flower onto the far-left stud and the red flower into the front right small stud. 94. One more vine to go! Locate another green vine, another pink flower with a stud, another leaf piece, and one green carrot top/stick. Place the vine in the same orientation as the last, then place the leaf piece on the far-right ridged stud, and the pink flower onto the back-left small stud. Now place this vine onto the vine from the last step by placing this current far-left stud onto the last step\u2019s far-right stud. Then place the carrot top/stick into the two aligning studs to secure both vines. 95. Last step! Take the long vine from the last step and attach the right side of the vine with the leaf piece to the stick hanging on the back side of the wall under the first vine you placed onto the main build. The three spikes of the leaf piece should point diagonally toward the enclosed and protected flower in the case/globe. Now the left side of the long vine should face the flower and pillow on the left side of the build. Congratulations! Now Aliya's Room is complete!

Place a dark brown 2x2 circular plate with four upward arms on the previous piece, centered verticallytically and horizontallyizontally. 5.2. Place a dark brown 2x2 circular brick on the previous piece, centered verticallytically and horizontallyizontally. 6. Now we\u2019ll make the branch a bit taller by adding a trunk. Place a dark brown 2x2 circular brick in front of you and put a light brown 2x2 circular tile with a hole onto it. Rotate this assembly 90 degrees so the circular tile is sideways on the left. 7. Place a dark brown straight axle connector onto one end of a light gray 9L axle. Push the axle through the assembly from step 6 from the left. Push it in until the axle connector touches the circular tile from the previous step. 8.1. Slide the center axle hole of a dark brown 2x2 circular brick onto the right end of the axle until it attaches to the 2x2 circular brick from step 6. 8.2. Slide the center axle hole of a dark brown 2x2 circular plate with four upward arms onto the right end of the axle, with the arms at the left. Push it to the left until it connects to the previous piece. 9.1. Slide another dark brown 2x2 circular brick onto the axle like we did in step 8.1. 9.2. Slide a dark brown 2x2 circular plate onto the axle from the right, until it attaches to the previous piece. 10. Rotate the trunk 90 degrees so the trunk is pointing up and down and the axle connector is at the top. Push the axle through the center of the 2x2 circular brick from step 5, pushing down until it connects to the circular brick from step 5. 11.1. Orient a green 6x5 plant leaves so that the end with only a single stud is at the left, and attach this stud onto the rightmost upward arm on the bottom 2x2 circular plate with four upwards arms. The rest of the plant leaves should extend to the right. A parallel column of two studs should be at the far right. 11.2. Place a dark brown square robot arm onto the far left upward arm on the bottom 2x2 circular plate with four arms. Use the square part of the robot arm to attach it, not the clip. The clip should be up and to the left. Place another dark brown square robot onto the front upward arm on the top 2x2 circular plate with four arms. Use the square part of the arm again, and the clip should be up and to the front. Open group 2. 12. Now we\u2019ll start building a blue and yellow flower, so set the base of the branch aside for now. Place a white 2x2 circular plate with an octagonal bar farm around it in front of you. 13. Place an orange 1x1 circular plate onto each stud of the previous piece so it makes a square of studs. 14.1. Now we\u2019ll make petals! Place a white 1x1 plate with a verticallytical clip on one side in front of you, with the clip on the right. 14.2, Place a yellow 1x2 curved slope tile, horizontallyizontally long, on the previous piece, sloping down to the right, and extending one stud to the left. The cut out should be on the left. 14.3. Attach a petal to each diagonal bar using the clip. The slope tile should be on top. If you draw a line through two opposite petals, it should go through two diagonal corners of the 2x2 square of studs described in step 12. Hinge all the petals down so they lay flat. 15.1. Now we\u2019ll make some larger petals. Place a light blue 1x2 half cylinder slope onto a white 1x2 plate with a verticallytical clip on one long side, with the clip on your left and the slope verticallytically long, sloping up to the left. Repeat this three more times to create a total of four larger petals. 15.2. Keeping the clip at the left, flip a petal overtically so the slope is at the bottom.

Group 18 contains transparent 1x2 tiles with orange koi fish printed on them, group 19 contains transparent 1x2 tiles with white koi fish printed on them, and group 20 contains light gray 1x1 circular tiles and light gray 1x6 tiles. Now we will start adding the transparent blue tiles and plates which make up the water of the creek. There are koi fish in the stream! We\u2019ll build the water one row at a time, building each row from right to left. For the next few steps, we\u2019ll do things a little bit differently. Because all colors are transparent blue, we won\u2019t tell you which color to grab! All tiles will be placed horizontallyizontally long, so we won\u2019t describe the orientation. 63.1. The first row, from right to left, is two 1x2 tiles, a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile. The right edges of the first 12 rows of the stream are all even. 63.2. The second row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, and a 1x1 plate. 63.3. The third row, from right to left, is a 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish print, a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile. 63.4. The fourth row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish print, a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile. 63.4. The fifth row, from right to left, is a 1x2 tile and a 1x4 tile. 63.5. The sixth row, from right to left, is a 1x4 tile and a 1x2 tile. 63.6. The seventh row is exactly like the fifth row. The eighth row is exactly like the sixth row. The ninth row is another repeat of the fifth row. 63.7. The tenth row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile. Now the orientations start to change. Unless otherwise stated, consider all 1x2 tiles as horizontallyizontal. 64.1. The eleventh row, from right to left, is two 1x2 tiles, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile, and a 1x1 plate. The verticallytical 1x2 tile is even with the back of the other pieces. 64.2. The twelfth row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, a verticallytical 1x2 tile with a koi fish pattern, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, a verticallytical 1x2 tile and a 1x2 tile. The verticallytical tile is even with the back of the other pieces. 64.3. The thirteenth row is offset one stud to the left. This row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, and a 1x1 plate. 64.4. The fourteenth row, from right to left, is a verticallytical 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, and a 1x2 tile. 64.5. The fifteenth row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate between the right two tiles from the fourteenth row, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, and a verticallytical 1x2 tile. 64.6. The sixteenth row is a 1x1 plate between the left two tiles from the fifteenth row. Let\u2019s take a second to check out our stream so far. From right to left, the first six columns should be unbroken columns of twelve, fifteen, fifteen, fifteen, sixteen, and sixteen. The seventh column from the right should have a shorizontallyt column of three at the back and six at the front, with seven exposed studs between. The eighth column should be a partial column with a column of two, then a single. The stream now turns ninety degrees to the left. We\u2019ll start making this turn by working from the twelfth row of the stream, and working towards the front. Because the pieces aren\u2019t nicely horizontallyizontal anymore, we aren\u2019t able to just move in a row from left to right. 65.1. Now we will extend the twelfth row. From right to left, a 1x1 plate, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, and a 1x2 tile. Place a light gray 1x1 circular tile behind the left stud of the last piece of this row. 65.2. Extend the thirteenth row, from right to left, a 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, and a 1x2 tile. 65.3. Extend the fourteenth row, from right to left, a 1x2 tile, skip overtically the flower plate, and a verticallytical 1x2 tile. 65.4. Extend the fifteenth row, from right to left, a 1x2 tile, and a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish pattern. 65.5. Extend the sixteenth row, from right to left, a 1x1 plate, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, and two 1x2 tiles. 65.6. The seventeenth row is a brand new row which starts in front of the right 1x1 from the previous row. From right to left, it is a verticallytical 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, and a 1x2 tile. 65.7. The eighteenth row, from right to left, skip overtically the first tile from the previous step, a 1x1 plate, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile. 65.8. The nineteenth row is offset two studs to the left from the previous row and, from right to left, is a verticallytical 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with a white koi fish pattern, and a verticallytical 1x2 tile. 65.9. The twentieth row is a 1x2 tile between the two verticallytical tiles from the previous step. 65.10. The twenty-first row is two 1x2 tiles. 65.11. The twenty-second row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile. Now let\u2019s take a quick look at how the stream is shaping up. The stream should now have 22 rows, and there should be one row of exposed studs at the front of the base, and one at the back. Row 22 (at the front of the build) should have fourteen exposed studs to the left of it. Row 21 should have thirteen exposed studs to the left of it. Rows 12-15 and row 17 should be even with row 22. Rows 16 and rows 18- 20 should be even with row 21. 66.1. Extend the twenty-second row to the left with three 1x2 tiles. 66.2. Now, we are going to change things up and work from left to right in columns. Almost all of the tiles in these columns will be verticallytically long, so use that orientation unless stated otherwise. First, place a horizontallyizontal 1x2 tile behind the left tile from the previous piece so its left edge is even with the 1x1 flower plate behind it. Extend this column, from front to back, with three 1x2 tiles. The right edges of this column should all be even. 66.3. The next column to the right, from front to back, is three 1x2 tiles, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish, and a 1x2 tile. 66.4. The next column to the right, from front to back, is a horizontallyizontal 1x2 tile, four 1x2 tiles, and a light gray 1x1 circular tile. 66.5. The next column to the right, starting behind the horizontallyizontal tile from the previous step and going from front to back, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, skip overtically the 1x1 flower plate, a horizontallyizontal 1x2 tile, a 1x1 plate, and two horizontallyizontal 1x2 tiles. 66.6. The next column to the right, from front to back, is a 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish, a horizontallyizontal 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, and a horizontallyizontal 1x2 tile. 66.7, Place a 1x2 tile behind the previous piece so the right edges are even. Place another behind the first. Hang on! We\u2019re almost done with the stream! Now, let\u2019s take stock of our creek again. Row 22 should have eight exposed studs to the left of it. Row 21 should only have seven. All of the other rows should be even with row 22. For the next few steps, we will be building columns from left to right. Again, most of the tiles in these columns will be verticallytically long, so use that orientation unless stated otherwise. 67.1. The first column we\u2019ll build is on the second column from the left on the base. From front to back, skipping overtically the front stud on the base, make a column of five 1x2 tiles. The front edges of all subsequent columns will be even with this one. 67.2. The second column, from front to back, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with a white koi fish, two 1x2 tiles, and a horizontallyizontally long light gray 1x6 tile which extends to the right. 67.3. The third column, from front to back, is a 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish, two 1x2 tiles, and a light gray 1x1 circular plate. 67.4. The fourth column, from front to back, is a horizontallyizontal 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile, a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, skip overtically the 1x1 flower plate, and a 1x2 tile. 67.5. The fifth column, from front to back, is four 1x2 tiles behind the tile from the previous step. 67.6. The sixth column, from front to back, is four 1x2 tiles, and a light gray 1x1 circular tile. 67.7. The last column, from front to back, is a 1x1 plate, skip overtically the tile and the 1x1 flower plate, and three 1x2 tiles. There should now be one exposed row of studs to the left of the stream, and one in front of it. The front and left edges of the stream should be unbroken lines of tiles and plates. Open group 21. 68.1. Now we\u2019ll build some water lilies for the stream. Place a green 2x2 dish in front of you, with the stud on top. 68.2. Place a purple five pointed leaf on the previous piece. 68.3. Place an orange 1x1 round tile with verticallytical ribs onto the stud inside the petals of the previous piece. That\u2019s one water lily complete! 68.4. Repeat steps 68.1-68.3 three more times to make a total of four water lilies. 68.5. Now we\u2019ll place the lilies. Starting on the back row of the stream, find the four studs which alternate left and right, with tiles on either side of them. Place one lilly on the second stud from the back. There should be a horizontallyizontal tile to the left and right of this lilly. 68.6. Now, feel straight in front of the previous lilly until you find another stud in the middle of the stream. This is right where the stream starts to turn left. Place a lilly on this stud. There should be a horizontallyizontal tile to the left and right of this lilly. 68.7. To place the next lilly, trace the left side of the verticallytical portion of the stream from back to front until the stream curves, then continue a little ways until you find a stud. Place a lilly on this stud. This should be in front of, and to the left of the previous lilly by a little bit. 68.8. The last lilly is on the front left portion of the stream. Find the two studs on the front row of the stream. Then find the column of two studs between them. Place the last lilly on the front stud. You can use the studs on the edge of the garden for reference. This lilly is on the sixth row from the front, and the fifth column from the left. Now we\u2019ve finished the stream! Open bag 5. Open group 22. 69.1. Now we\u2019ll start building up the garden behind and to the left of the stream. Place a dark brown 1x16 brick, horizontallyizontally long, on the second row from the back of the base so there is one exposed stud to the left of it. 69.2.

Attach the back clip of one bridge section to one of the tube assemblies, immediately to the right of the left bar connector. Attach the other bridge sections to the right of the first. The last one should be immediately to the left of the right bar connector. 116.7. Attach the other tube assembly onto the front clips of the bridge sections. The flat sides of the bar connectors on each end of the tubes should be on the top and bottom. You can rotate these while they\u2019re still attached to the tube. 116.8. Attach a red robot arm with a clip on each side to the front tube between the middle two bridge sections. The elbow of the arm is bent slightly, and the pointed side should point back towards the bridge sections. Repeat this symmetricallyetrically on the back side of the bridge. These will support the bridge railing. 116.9. Now we\u2019ll attach the bridge to the garden. Find the two clips on the left bank of the stream. These are at the verticallyy end of the stepping stone path. Attach the bars on the left side of the bridge to the two clips. Then, attach the other two bars on the bridge to the clips on the right side of the stream. Since the bridge is longer than the stream, you\u2019ll need to bend the tubes so the bridge arches overtically the stream! 117.1. Now we\u2019ll make the bridge rails. Place a red 8L tube, horizontallyizontally long, in front of you. 117.2. Place a red bar connector with a bar on one end, with the bar on the left, on the left end of the previous piece.

Find the four 1x1 flower plates in the stream on the left side of the garden. The first is on the third column from the left in front of the rocks. The second is on the sixth column from the left between a water lily and a lantern. The third is on the eleventh column from the right behind a lantern. The last one is on the fourteenth column from the left, to the right of a rock. Place one support on each of these 1x1 flower plates. Angle the supports so the flat faces are all parallel with the imaginary lines between the first and second flower plates, and the second, third, and fourth flower plates. 120.4. Now we will place the tall supports for the tea room. The tea room is placed at an angle on single studs. The first four supports will be placed in the stream. The first support goes on the stud which is in the stream behind the far left water lilly. 120.5. The second support goes on the first stud to the right of the front left water lilly. This is between the water lilly and the first lantern. 120.6. Continue to the right of the second support until you find a lantern (if you did not place the lanterns yet this will just be a stud). There should be two studs behind this lantern/stud. Place the third support on the first one. 120.7. Continue behind the second support until you find the stud, then move right. You will find a rock. Find the stud which is just behind and to the right of the rock. Place the last tall support on this stud. 120.5. Find the three 2x2 angled slope bricks behind the stream. The first is on the leftmost column in front of a tree. The second is to the right of the stack of 4x4 tiles with rounded corners. The third is just to the left of the two trees to the left of the bridge. Place a brown 1x1 brick on each of these pieces. 121. Now, rotate the garden 180 degrees so it is horizontallyizontally long and the bridge is closer to the front. Now, we\u2019ll attach the tea room to the support we placed. Place the tea room in front of you, with the entry at the front right. Rotate it so it is in line with the supports from the previous two steps and attach it to them. It should be at close to a 45 degree angle to the rest of the garden. When placed, it should overticallyhang the supports by half a stud on all four sides. Once the tea room is attached, carefully rotate the supports so their flat faces are parallel to the walls of the tea room. The 4x4 tiles with rounded corners should lead up to the entryway like a staircase. Open bag 10. Sub-build 1 - First deciduous tree Open group 43. 122.1.

        "instructions": "Instructions: Open bag 1. Open minifigure group 1. Assemble the Batman minifigure. Start by placing the torso onto the leg piece. The legs are black. The torso is black with a yellow oval with a bat on the front and an orange utility belt across the waist. This belt is where Batman keeps his many useful gadgets! The torso is printed on both the front and back. On the back, you can see a batarang clipped to the back of the utility belt. Place the head on the stud on top of the torso. The face has two sides; one side is a normal face and the other has a pair of white eyes above the normal eyes. These eyes are designed to show through the holes in the Batman mask! If you have a sighted friend helping you build, ask them to make sure the white eyes are at the front. Now place the Batman mask with a cape on the head. Place a black batarang in Batman\u2019s hand to complete the minifigure! Main Build: Open group 1. 1.1. We\u2019ll build the corner of a Gotham City skyscraper for Batman to stand on! The corner of the building is decorated with a small gargoyle. Start by placing a light gray 3x3 plate in front of you. 1.2.

        "introduction": "Welcome to text-based instructions from LEGO for the Blind.",
        "terminology": "",
        "instructions": "Instructions: Note for helpers: I have broken some of LEGO\u2019s original instructions into smaller steps, but I have kept the original base number. For example, step 5 is now steps 5.1 and 5.2. Side build - Tree branch with flowers. Open bag 1. Open group 1. 1.1. We will start with the base of the branch. Place a green 4x6 half circular plate in front of you, with the flat side at the back. 1.2. Place a dark brown 2x2 circular brick on the back row of the previous piece, centered horizontallyizontally, extending one stud to the back. 2. Place a green 4x6 half circular plate behind the first half circular plate, with the flat side at the front so the two half-circles make an entire circle. 3. Place a dark green 2x2 slope in front of the 2x2 circular brick, centered horizontallyizontally, sloping down to the front. Place another dark green 2x2 slope symmetricallyetrically behind the 2x2 circular brick. Place a dark green 2x2 slope to the left of the 2x2 circular brick, sloping down to the left. Place another dark green 2x2 slope symmetricallyetrically to the right of the 2x2 circular brick. 4. Place a light brown 4x4 circular plate on the previous pieces, centered verticallytically and horizontallyizontally. 5.1. Place a dark brown 2x2 circular plate with four upward arms on the previous piece, centered verticallytically and horizontallyizontally. 5.2. Place a dark brown 2x2 circular brick on the previous piece, centered verticallytically and horizontallyizontally. 6. Now we\u2019ll make the branch a bit taller by adding a trunk. Place a dark brown 2x2 circular brick in front of you and put a light brown 2x2 circular tile with a hole onto it. Rotate this assembly 90 degrees so the circular tile is sideways on the left. 7. Place a dark brown straight axle connector onto one end of a light gray 9L axle. Push the axle through the assembly from step 6 from the left. Push it in until the axle connector touches the circular tile from the previous step. 8.1. Slide the center axle hole of a dark brown 2x2 circular brick onto the right end of the axle until it attaches to the 2x2 circular brick from step 6. 8.2. Slide the center axle hole of a dark brown 2x2 circular plate with four upward arms onto the right end of the axle, with the arms at the left. Push it to the left until it connects to the previous piece. 9.1. Slide another dark brown 2x2 circular brick onto the axle like we did in step 8.1. 9.2. Slide a dark brown 2x2 circular plate onto the axle from the right, until it attaches to the previous piece. 10. Rotate the trunk 90 degrees so the trunk is pointing up and down and the axle connector is at the top. Push the axle through the center of the 2x2 circular brick from step 5, pushing down until it connects to the circular brick from step 5. 11.1. Orient a green 6x5 plant leaves so that the end with only a single stud is at the left, and attach this stud onto the rightmost upward arm on the bottom 2x2 circular plate with four upwards arms. The rest of the plant leaves should extend to the right. A parallel column of two studs should be at the far right. 11.2. Place a dark brown square robot arm onto the far left upward arm on the bottom 2x2 circular plate with four arms. Use the square part of the robot arm to attach it, not the clip. The clip should be up and to the left. Place another dark brown square robot onto the front upward arm on the top 2x2 circular plate with four arms. Use the square part of the arm again, and the clip should be up and to the front. Open group 2. 12. Now we\u2019ll start building a blue and yellow flower, so set the base of the branch aside for now. Place a white 2x2 circular plate with an octagonal bar farm around it in front of you. 13. Place an orange 1x1 circular plate onto each stud of the previous piece so it makes a square of studs. 14.1. Now we\u2019ll make petals! Place a white 1x1 plate with a verticallytical clip on one side in front of you, with the clip on the right. 14.2, Place a yellow 1x2 curved slope tile, horizontallyizontally long, on the previous piece, sloping down to the right, and extending one stud to the left. The cut out should be on the left. 14.3. Attach a petal to each diagonal bar using the clip. The slope tile should be on top. If you draw a line through two opposite petals, it should go through two diagonal corners of the 2x2 square of studs described in step 12. Hinge all the petals down so they lay flat. 15.1. Now we\u2019ll make some larger petals. Place a light blue 1x2 half cylinder slope onto a white 1x2 plate with a verticallytical clip on one long side, with the clip on your left and the slope verticallytically long, sloping up to the left. Repeat this three more times to create a total of four larger petals. 15.2. Keeping the clip at the left, flip a petal overtically so the slope is at the bottom. Attach it to the far right verticallytical bar on the flower. Hinge it 90 degrees counterclockwise so the plate with a clip is at the left and the slope is at the right. Repeat this for each larger petal, keeping the slope on the outside of the flower and the plate with a clip on the inside. Flip the flower overtically so its face is down. 16.1. Place a tan 1x2 plate with a bar on one long side in front of you, horizontallyizontally long, with the bar at the front. 16.2. Place a dark green 2x2 inverticallyted curved slope tile on the bottom of the previous piece, so it slopes up in the back. 16.3. Place a black 2x2 circular plate on the pieces from the previous step. Flip the assembly overtically and attach it to the flower, centered verticallytically and horizontallyizontally. Rotate the flower so its studs are sideways on the left, and the bar from step 16.1 is above the curved tile slope from step 16.2. 17. Set the base of the branch in front of you with the leaf on the right. Attach the bar from step 16.1 to the left robot arm on the branch.The flower should hang down off the branch. Rotate the flower so its face is angled up at about 45 degrees. Open group 3. 18. We\u2019re going to build another flower now. It\u2019s built the same way as the first, but using two shades of pink. Place a white 2x2 circular plate with an octagonal bar farm around it in front of you. 19. Place a yellow 1x1 circular plate with a flower pattern onto each stud of the previous piece so it makes a square of studs. 20.1. Now we\u2019ll make petals! Place a light purple 1x2 curved slope tile onto a white 1x1 plate with a verticallytical clip, with the clip on your right, and the slope horizontallyizontally long, sloping up to the left. Repeat this three more times to create a total of four small petals. 20.2. Attach a petal to each diagonal bar using the clip. The slope tile should be on top. If you draw a line through two opposite petals, it should go through two diagonal corners of the 2x2 square of studs described in step 12. Hinge all the petals down so they lay flat. 21.1. Now we\u2019ll make some larger petals. Place a pink 1x2 half cylinder slope onto a white 1x2 plate with a verticallytical clip on one long side, with the clip on your left and the slope verticallytically long, sloping up to the left. Repeat this three more times to create a total of four larger petals. 21.2. Keeping the clip at the left, flip a petal overtically so the slope is at the bottom. Attach it to the far right verticallytical bar on the flower. Hinge it 90 degrees counterclockwise so the plate with a clip is at the left and the slope is at the right. Repeat this for each larger petal, keeping the slope on the outside of the flower and the plate with a clip on the inside. Flip the flower overtically so its face is down. 22.1. Place a tan 1x2 plate with a bar on one long side in front of you, horizontallyizontally long, with the bar at the front. 22.2. Place a dark green 2x2 inverticallyted curved slope tile on the previous piece, so it slopes up in the back. 22.3. Place a black 2x2 circular plate on the pieces from the previous step. Flip the assembly overtically and attach it to the flower, centered verticallytically and horizontallyizontally. Rotate the flower so its studs are sideways on the left, and the bar from step 16.1 is above the curved tile slope from step 16.2. 23. Set the base of the branch in front of you with the leaf on the right. Attach the bar from step 16.1 to the front robot arm on the branch.The flower should hang down off the branch. Rotate the flower so its face is angled up at about 45 degrees. Open group 4. 24.1. Place a light green 4x3 plant leaves in front of you, horizontallyizontally long. The leaves at the left end should come to a point like a sideways letter V. 24.2. Place two purple 1x1 plates with three leaves on the far right stud, one on top of the other. Place these two pieces so the leaves face away from each other, so they form a flower with six petals. 24.3. Place an orange 1x1 circular plate on the top piece from the previous step. Repeat steps 24.1-24.3 to make another leaf with a flower. 24.4. Attach one leaf with a small flower to the top right upwards bar on the branch, using the stud on the opposite end from the flower, above the 6x5 leaf piece. Attach the other leaf with a small flower to the top back upwards arm. Main build - Pink Parrot: Open group 5. 25.1. Now we\u2019ll start building the parrot! The parrot stands on the branch, and we\u2019ll start with its feet. Push the axle of a blue axle/pin combo into the straight axle connector pointing up at the top of the branch. 25.2. Place a black pin connector with two 2L thin lift-arms on one side down overtically the previous piece, with the lift-arms pointing up. This piece will spin freely. 26.1. Place a dark gray 4L axle with a circular stop at one end in front of you with the stop down and the axle pointing up. 26.2. Slide a black 3L axle with a hole in the middle overtically the previous piece. The axle will spin freely. This is the stick that the parrot is perched on. 27. Place a dark gray thick bushing with a perpendicular bar on each side onto the axle, with the bar extending right and left. The parrot\u2019s talons will attach to these bars. 28. Slide two dark pink thin bushings overtically the upwards axle from step 25.1. Push them down until they touch the previous piece. This is one of the parrot\u2019s feet! Repeat steps 26.1-28 to make another. 29. Find the pin connector with two 2L lift-arms from step 25.2. Spin it so the lift-arms are at the front. Keeping the axle up, push the stick (3L axle with hole from step 26.2.) into the top axle hole on the left liftarm from the left. Repeat this symmetricallyetrically on the right. Now the parrots legs should stick upwards! 30. We\u2019re going to decorate the perch a little bit. Place a dark brown 3-way axle connector with a center pin hole in front of you, so one leg points to your left, and the other two legs angle to the right. Place a 1L pin in the center hole with the stud up. 31. Place a light green bar with two leaves on top into the stud on the pin. 32. Place a 2L axle into each of the two right legs of the axle connector. 33. Place a brown 1x1 cone onto each of the pieces from the previous step. 34. Attach a light green 4x3 plant leaves onto each cone so the leaves hang downwards. Attach using the stud where the leaves come to a point. 35. Stick a light green bar with two leaves on top through the stud attached to the cone from the previous pieces. 36. Attach this branch assembly to the right side of the perch using the empty leg of the 3-way axle connector, with one leg up and the other down. Once it is attached, adjust the angle of the leaves to your liking. Open group 6. 37.1. Now the parrot will get some talons! Push a black bar with a claw into the bar hole of a dark gray bar connector with a clip at one end. Repeat this step 3 more times to make 3 more talons. 37.2. Attach the clip of one talon to the left bar on the left bushing with a bar from step 27. Rotate it so it hangs down, with the claw pointing towards the back. You can spin the claw in the bar holder. Place another talon on the right bar of the same piece. Repeat this for the foot on the right. 38. Place a brown cone onto the left axle of the perch. 39.1. Now it\u2019s time to start making the body of the parrot, working upwards from the legs. Set the branch aside for now. Place a dark pink 2x2 plate with an inverticallyted slope at each end, and a cut out, in front of you, verticallytically long. Place a light blue 1x2 plate with two verticallytical clips on one long side on the back row of the previous piece, horizontallyizontally long with the clips at the back. 39.2. Place a magenta 1x2 brick with an axle hole verticallytically long on the left column in front of the previous piece. Place another to the right of the first. 39.3 Place a dark pink 1x2 plate horizontallyizontally long in front of the pieces from the previous step. 39.4. Place a black 4L axle through the two bricks with axle holes so it extends one stud past on both sides. 39.5. Place a dark pink T-shaped axle connector onto each side of the axle, using the axle hole that goes all the way through, so that it hangs down right next to the parrot\u2019s body. 39.6. Place the base in front of you, with one flower at the front and one at the left. Now, using the last two pieces, attach the body to the legs, keeping the two clips at the back of the body. Open group 7. 40. Now we\u2019ll start on the parrot\u2019s chest. Set the branch and legs aside for now. Place a magenta 2x4 plate horizontallyizontally long in front of you and put a white 1x2x2 tall brick with studs on three sides verticallytically long, on the right column of the previous piece, with side studs on the right. 41.

Assemble the drivertically minifigure using the tan-colored legs, pineapple-patterned torso, female head, and dark orange hair. You can reposition her arms to appear as if she is holding a steering wheel and prepare for her to drive! Main-build \u2014 Land Rovertically Classic Defender. 1. Locate one dark gray 2x12 plate. Place it in front of you with the long axis running horizontallyizontally. 2. Locate one black 4x4 plate and two medium gray 1x2 grille tiles. Place the 4x4 plate on the 2x12 plate, horizontallyizontally centered. Now place one grille tile verticallytically on the immediate left of the 4x4 plate, place the other grill tile symmetricallyetrically on the right. This is the base and bottom of the car! 3. Locate two black 2x2 plates. Flip your structure upside-down, keeping the same overticallyall horizontallyizontal orientation. Place each 2x2 plate on the 2x12 plate, skipping one stud in from each side, symmetricallyetrically. 4. Locate four yellow pegs and four medium gray 2x2 plates with pin holes. Flip your structure so the studs are upright. Place each of the pegs into each of the plates\u2019 pin holes. Now put two plates verticallytically together and place them to the immediate left of the left grille tile, with one peg facing front and one facing back, leaving a one stud overticallyhang on the front and back. Symmetrically do the same on the immediate right side of the right grille tile. These are the axles that will hold the wheels. 5. Locate two black 2x2 plates. Place each on the far right and far left, overticallyhanging one stud on either side horizontallyizontally. 6. Locate one tan 2x2 modified tile with two studs and one medium gray 2x10 plate. Place the tan 2x2 plate skipping one stud in from the left and with the two verticallytical studs facing right. Now place the 2x10 plate to the immediate right of the 2x2 plate. This tan plate signifies the left side of the build as the front of the car! 7. Locate two yellow 2x4 plates and four medium gray 1x2 plates with rounded edges. Horizontally place the yellow 2x4 plate on the front-center of the build, and then symmetricallyetrically on the back-center. Now horizontallyizontally place each rounded piece onto each of the four plates with attached pegs. 8. Locate two black 2x2 half brick-half plates with attached arches. Horizontally place these onto the two far-right rounded plates with the arches facing the outer edges. The pieces will overticallyhang by two horizontallyizontal studs. 9. Locate one medium gray 4x6 plate. Place this, with the long axis running horizontallyizontally, onto the center of the build, leaving four exposed studs on the front and back of the yellow 2x4 plates underneath. 10. Locate one 1x4 yellow plate and one white 2x2 stair piece with a total of 6 studs. Place the 1x4 yellow plate on the right edge of the previously placed 4x6 medium gray plate, verticallytically. Now place the 2x2 white stair piece onto the tan 2x2 modified tile with two studs at the edge and with the thicker step of the stair attached to the tan studs. Note that the two studs sticking out of the stair piece are facing left. 11. Locate two yellow 1x2 bricks and four 1x2 bricks with slopes. Along the four yellow exposed studs along the front-center and back-center of the build, place horizontallyizontally, from left to right, an upward slope facing left, followed by the regular 1x2 brick, followed by another upward slope but facing right. 12. Locate two more black 2x2 half brick-half plates with attached arches. Place each onto the left rounded plates with each arch facing the outside of the build. 13. Locate one medium gray steering wheel and two tan 2x2 bricks with a rounded top/curved slope and two studs on the edge. Vertically place both tan 2x2 bricks to the immediate right of the white stair piece, side by side with the slopes facing left and the two studs facing right. Now place the steering wheel to the immediate right of the two sloped-bricks, centered-verticallytically, with the back of the steering wheel facing left. 14. Locate one yellow 1x1 flat tile and one medium gray 1x1 headlight brick with one stud on the top and one stud on a side. Place the yellow 1x1 tile on the side stud and align the square edges perfectly. 15. Locate a black 1x6 plate and place it down separately to the build with its long axis running horizontallyizontally. Place the previously assembled headlight brick from step 14 onto the second stud from the left on the black 1x6 plate. Ensure that the yellow 1x1 tile on the side of the headlight brick is facing front. 16. Locate one yellow 2x2 L corner brick and one regular yellow 2x2 brick. Place the L corner brick to the immediate right of the headlight brick so that, together, both pieces form a square shape. To the immediate right of the L brick, place the regular 2x2 brick, leaving one stud exposed on the right. 17. Locate one yellow 1x2 brick and one medium gray 1x2 brick with two studs on top and two stud indentations on a side. Place the regular yellow 1x2 brick onto the headlight brick and the L brick horizontallyizontally. Now place the gray 1x2 brick with two indentations to the immediate right of the yellow brick, horizontallyizontally and with the indentations facing you. 18. Locate one yellow 1x4 flat tile and one black peg. Place the yellow 1x4 tile horizontallyizontally on top of the previous two bricks. Now place the peg into the left indentation of the gray brick from the last step. 19.1. Locate two yellow 1x1x2 bricks with two studs on a side and two transparent red round 1x1 tiles. Place, symmetricallyetrically and verticallytically, each of the yellow bricks on either side of the 1x6 plate, leaving no more studs from that plate exposed and ensuring that the top stud is facing the ceiling and the two side studs are facing you. Now place each transparent red round tile on the front upper stud on each previously placed brick. 19.2. Locate two transparent orange 1x1 round tiles. Place the transparent orange round tiles on the sidebottom studs under the red round tiles and on the same 1x1x2 bricks in the previous step. 20. Locate one long medium gray L bench-like panel. Rotate the build 180 degrees so that the previous side that was facing you is now facing away from you. Now place the panel horizontallyizontally on top of the four exposed studs on the side of the build that is facing you so that the wall is facing back. 21. Take this structure and attach this to the rear of the car, which should be the right of the build if the car is still running horizontallyizontally. The side of the previously built structure with the long gray L panel should be facing left toward the front of the car and align with the two studs at the right edge of the 2x6 plate in the rear of the car. This structure should also attach to the two exposed studs at the far-most right, so in total, it is attached to the main build by four studs. 22. Locate two yellow 1x8 plates, two yellow 1x4 plates and two yellow, 1x1 plates. Assemble all of these pieces before attaching it to the main build. Start with the 1x8 plate running horizontallyizontally. Place the 1x1 plate underneath the 1x8 plate at the far-most right stud. Then horizontallyizontally place the 1x4 on top of the 1x8 plate at the far-most right. Repeat this with the other 1x8, 1x1, and 1x4 plates located in this step. Now place each of these assemblies on the main build horizontallyizontally and symmetricallyetrically to one another on the front and back. The 1x4 plates should face the rear of the car or the right of the build, leaving four exposed studs on the 1x8 plate facing the front of the car. They should go on the right side of the build and the 1x1 plate will fit into the gap between the wheel axle and the structure from step 21. 23. Locate two long yellow 1x4 flat tiles. Place each horizontallyizontally and symmetricallyetrically to one another on the four studs exposed on the rear of the car leaving one stud of the previous 1x4 plates exposed. These long tiles should align perfectly with the far-right of the build. 24. Locate two yellow 1x2 slope pieces. On the same front and back long sides of the car, place each slope downward, symmetricallyetrically to one another, facing inward toward the inside of the car, and to the immediate left of the single exposed studs from both 1x4 plates near the rear of the car. 25. Locate one medium gray 1x4 plate and one tan 1x2 brick with two bumps on its sides. Vertically place the 1x4 plate on top of the two verticallytical studs to the left of the 2x2 bricks with rounded top/curved slopes from step 13. Now verticallytically place the bumpy 1x2 brick to the left of the 1x4 plate just placed, leaving a small gap where the slopes are and two verticallytical studs to the left of the bumpy brick exposed. 26. Locate two yellow 2x3 plates. Horizontally and symmetricallyetrically, place each on the front and back long sides of the car. These plates should be touching both front-of-car arches. Align these perfectly and horizontallyizontally so that no part of this piece overticallyhangs. Vertically, there will be two studs between the two pieces. 27. Locate four yellow 1x1 plates. Start by connecting two of them and placing this to the immediate left of the step 24 1x2 downward slope pieces in the center of a long side of the car. Repeat this symmetricallyetrically by connecting the other two 1x1 plates and placing them to the left of the other 1x2 downward slope on the other long side. 28. Locate one medium gray 1x6 tile, one medium gray 2x3 plate, and one medium gray 1x2 brick with two studs at the top and two studs on a side. Vertically and symmetricallyetrically place the 1x6 tile on the far\u2013 most left and verticallyy front of the car, leaving the same amount of space overticallyhanging on the front and back. Now place the 2x3 plate horizontallyizontally to the immediate left of the back of the steering wheel. Now place the 1x2 brick to the immediate left of the 2x3 plate, leaving the two side studs of the brick facing left. 29. Locate two yellow 1x2 tiles, two yellow 1x4 plates, and two yellow 1x2 plates. Horizontally and symmetricallyetrically to both front and back long sides of the car, place the 1x2 flat tile immediately next to and touching the two left tire arches, aligning its left edge to the pieces underneath and leaving no overticallyhang. To the immediate right of the 1x2 tiles, horizontallyizontally place the 1x2 plates. Now to fill in the two long horizontallyizontal gaps in the front of the car, horizontallyizontally and symmetricallyetrically place each 1x4 plate on the next studs inward from the previously placed 1x2 tiles and plates. 30. Locate one black 1x4 window frame. Vertically place this, three studs to the right of the steering wheel, aligning the frame onto the four raised studs on a previous yellow 1x4 plate. You have just built a separation between the space for the drivertically and the trunk! 31. Just a heads up that this step will be repeated! Locate one yellow 1x2 tile, one yellow 1x1 plate, one transparent 1x2x4 window, and one 1x1x2 brick with two studs on a side. Assemble these new pieces before attaching this to the main build. To start, place the 1x1 plate underneath the 1x1 brick with side studs. Now connect this to the window piece horizontallyizontally with the two side studs of the brick and the two holes of the window. Now place the 1x2 tile onto the other side of the window, perfectly aligning the two studs. To attach this structure to the car, place this on the stud in front of the step 20 window frame. This should be on the front long side of the car with the brick side of the window facing left and the tile side of the window facing right. Ensure that the window is not facing inward towards the car. 32. Repeat the previous step but place the window structure on the back long side. This is really starting to feel like a car! 33. Locate a yellow 1x6 tile. Vertically place this on top of the previously placed black 1x4 frame, perfectly aligning the edges and leaving no overticallyhang. 34. Locate a medium gray 1x2 rounded plate. Do not place or attach this piece yet. 35. Locate two yellow 2x2 stair pieces with two studs on a side. Place both yellow stairs side by side symmetricallyetrically with the highest stair and all four side studs facing you. Now connect both 2x2 pieces with the 1x2 rounded plate on the lowest stair in the center, leaving one stud exposed on either side of the lowest steps. 36. Locate two yellow 2x2 L corner plates with three studs each. Orient one as the braille letter \u201cf\u201d then place it on the back-left stud. Now orient the other as the braille letter \u201cd\u201d then place it on the back-right stud. Ensure that this 2x6 rectangular structure has the long axis running horizontallyizontally. 37. Locate two yellow 1x2 tiles with one stud on top. Place the two tiles side by side verticallytically and symmetricallyetrically in the center, leaving four 2x2 studs exposed on either sides. 38. Locate two yellow and black 2x2 tiles with one stud and two printed circles at one of the edges. Place each 2x2 tile on either side of the previously placed 1x2 tiles, perfectly forming a rectangle with no overticallyhang or exposed studs from underneath. Ensure that the two printed circles on the left tile face the left and the two printed circles on the right face the right. 39. Locate one black 2x3 tile (this tile may have had a sticker placed on it by a helper previously) and two transparent 1x1 circle tiles. Symmetrically place each 1x1 circle on each stud from the previous yellow and black 2x2 tiles with printed circles. In between the two transparent circle tiles, place the black 2x3 tile horizontallyizontally and in the center. 40. Locate two yellow 1x1 plates. Flip this structure upside down with the long axis running horizontallyizontally still and the same side facing front and back still. Symmetrically place each 1x1 plate on the far-back-left and far-back-right. 41. Flip this structure back around so that the sides that were facing front and back remain the same. If you haven\u2019t already, locate the car grille sticker displaying the word \u201cDEFENDER\u201d in the center with a printed green bumper sticker on the bottom right corner reading \u201cLAND-ROVER.\u201d Place this sticker onto the black 2x3 tile or move onto the next step if this was already done. 42. Attach this structure to the side studs facing left on the main build, while ensuring the words are upright. The four side studs should face up, forming a 5x4 on the top hood of the car. This is really coming together! 43. Locate one medium gray 1x4 plate and two circle pieces with small sticks attached. Place each of the two circles with sticks to the immediate left of each of the two 1x1 plates in the center-long-sides of the car. Have the long parts of the pieces stick outward of the car. You have just built part of the side mirrors! Now verticallytically place the 1x4 plate in between the two circle-and-stick pieces. This is the base for the large car windshield! 44. Locate a large 1x6 transparent window panel with a downward slope. Place the window on top of all three pieces placed in the previous step. Ensure that the slope is facing the left toward the front of the car. 45. Locate one yellow 1x2 tile, one yellow 1x3 left wing/angle plate with three studs, one yellow 1x3 right wing plate with three studs, one yellow 2x3 plate, and two yellow 1x1 quarter circle tiles. Now let\u2019s build the hood of the car! Start by creating a trapezoid shape onto the immediate left of the car windshield using the 2x3 plate and the two 2x3 wing/angle plates. The longest side of the trapezoid should align with the bottom edge/slope of the windshield and the 2x3 plate should be horizontallyizontal. Now place the 1x2 tile verticallytically to the immediate left of the 2x3 plate. Then place the quarter circle tiles in front and behind that piece with the rounded corners facing outward. To reiterate, ensure that the hood has a cohesive trapezoid shape with rounded corners at the verticallyy front of the car. 46. Locate a yellow 2x4 tile, a yellow 1x2 tile, and two yellow 1x1 quarter circle tiles. To the immediate right of the three pieces just placed, repeat the same build by verticallytically placing the 1x2 tile along with the two 1x1 rounded quarter circles behind and in front of the 1x2. Now to the immediate right of these pieces, verticallytically place the 2x4 tile. You have just created layers that give the illusion of a curved and raised hood! 47. Locate two black 1x1 plates with hooks on one end. To complete the side mirrors, attach these with the singular studs facing the front of the car and by connecting the hook onto the top side of the previously placed rods that stick out from underneath the sides of the windshield. 48. Locate five black tires and five black wheel rims with pin holes. Insert all five rims into the outer tires and attach four wheels to the pegs under the four arches. Now place the fifth tire on the rear of the car on the right of the build and connect it with the peg already placed from step 18. Now all you need is the roof! 49. Locate one yellow 2x4 plate. Place it down on your surface verticallytically and do not attach it to anything yet. 50. Locate one white 4x4 arch/bridge plate. Vertically place this piece on top of the 2x4 plate from the last step, leaving 1x4 studs exposed on the left. These pieces should be connected by only four studs and the 4x4 arch should be to the right of and coverticallying half of the 2x4 plate. 51. Locate one white 4x4 downward slope with only four studs. Place this verticallytically with the four studs on the edge facing the right and the slope facing the left. Align the four studs with the four exposed studs from the last step on the bottom 2x4 plate. This connects both 4x4 pieces to create the base of the roof! 52. Locate one yellow 1x4 plate. Flip overtically the roof while ensuring the slope is still facing left and the arch is still on the right. Now verticallytically place the 1x4 plate on the far-right, filling the gap in the arch piece. 53. Locate two yellow 1x4 plates and two yellow 1x2 plates. Symmetrically and horizontallyizontally place each 1x4 plate on the sides facing front and back, aligning the edges all the way to the right and leaving no overticallyhang. Now symmetricallyetrically and horizontallyizontally place each 1x2 plate on the second stud to the left, skipping overtically one stud. You are so close to finishing! You got this! 54. Locate two black 1x6 plates. Flip overtically the roof so that the slope is still facing the left. Place each 1x6 plate all the way to each edge/side facing front and back, symmetricallyetrically, horizontallyizontally, leaving 2x4 studs in between the two 1x6 plates exposed and leaving 1x4 studs all the way to the right of the roof exposed. 55. Locate two black 3x6 rectangular pipe racks with four studs. Vertically place these side by side, lining up each of the studs of the roof rack to the previously placed 1x6 plates. You have just finished the roof! 56. Last step! Attach the roof to the top of the main build with the slope facing left, ensuring that it is facing the same way as the downward slope of the windshield, the layered hood, and the car grille with a sticker. Congratulations! Now the Land Rovertically Classic Defender is complete! The next page shows how you can lift the roof off and place the drivertically inside the car and to the right of the windshield and steering wheel. The page after shows the completed Land Rovertically, with the drivertically behind the wheel and the roof placed back on. Thank you",

        "instructions": "Instructions: Open bag 1. Open minifigure group 1. Assemble the Batman minifigure. Start by placing the torso onto the leg piece. The legs are black. The torso is black with a yellow oval with a bat on the front and an orange utility belt across the waist. This belt is where Batman keeps his many useful gadgets! The torso is printed on both the front and back. On the back, you can see a batarang clipped to the back of the utility belt. Place the head on the stud on top of the torso. The face has two sides; one side is a normal face and the other has a pair of white eyes above the normal eyes. These eyes are designed to show through the holes in the Batman mask! If you have a sighted friend helping you build, ask them to make sure the white eyes are at the front. Now place the Batman mask with a cape on the head. Place a black batarang in Batman\u2019s hand to complete the minifigure! Main Build: Open group 1. 1.1. We\u2019ll build the corner of a Gotham City skyscraper for Batman to stand on! The corner of the building is decorated with a small gargoyle. Start by placing a light gray 3x3 plate in front of you. 1.2. Place a black 2x2 brick on the previous piece, even with the back right corner. 2.1. Place a light gray 1x2 inverticallyted slope, with the slope at the front, in front of the right column of the 2x2 brick from the previous step. Place another, with the slope at the left, to the left of the back row of the 2x2 brick from the previous step. 2.2. Place a dark gray 1x1 brick to the left of the front piece from the previous step. Place another in front of the left piece from the previous step. Now, only the front left stud of the 3x3 plate from step 1.1 should be exposed. 3. Place a light gray 2x2 double inverticallyted slope, with slopes at the front and the left, to the left of the front piece from the previous step. It should be on the last remaining stud of the 3x3 plate. 4. Place a dark gray 4x4 plate on top of the build. 5.1. Place a dark gray 1x2 plate with rounded ends, horizontallyizontally long, on the rightmost two studs on the back row of the previous piece. 5.2. Place a black 1x2 plate with a horizontallyizontal clip on one shorizontallyt side, with the clip at the right, in front of the previous piece. The clip should overticallyhang the 4x4 plate to the right. 6.1. Place a light gray 2x2 tile with two studs, with the studs at the right, in front of the previous piece. Place another, with the studs at the back, on the left two rows of the 4x4 plate, even with the back. 6.2. Place a light gray 1x1 circular plate in front of the right stud on the left piece from the previous step. 7.1. Place a dark gray 1x1 slope tile, with the thick side at the right, in front of the 1x1 circular plate from the previous step. Place another, with the thick side at the back, to the left of the 1x1 circular plate from the previous step. 7.2. Attach the center hand hold of a black batarang to the clip on the right side of the build. Open group 2. 8. Place a black 2x2 brick on the build, even with the back right corner. 9.1. Place a dark gray 1x2 masonry brick, horizontallyizontally long, in front of the 2x2 brick from the previous step. A masonry brick has a brick wall pattern on one side, and horizontallyizontal grooves on the other side. The side with verticallytical and horizontallyizontal grooves should be at the front. Place another masonry brick, verticallytically long with the verticallytical and horizontallyizontal grooves at the left, to the left of the 2x2 brick from the previous step. 9.2. Place a dark gray 1x1 brick to the left of the front piece from the previous step. 10. Place a light gray 3x3 plate on the raised part of the build, even with the back right corner. 11. Place a dark gray 2x2 tile with a stud, on the front two rows of the previous piece, even with the left side. 12.1. Now we\u2019ll start the gargoyle. Place a light gray 1x1 circular plate in front of you. 12.2. Place a light gray 1x1 brick with studs on all four sides on the previous piece. 12.3. Place a light gray 1x1 circular plate on the front side stud of the previous piece. 12.4. Place a light gray 1x1 plate with a shorizontallyt bar on one side, with the bar on top, on the right side stud of the 1x1 brick with studs on all four sides. Place another, symmetricallyetrically, on the left. 12.5. Attach a light gray triangle with a clip on one side to each of the bars. Attach them so one point of the triangle is at the back, and one side of the triangle forms a verticallytical line at the front. Once they are attached, hinge them so they angle towards each other. These are the wings of the gargoyle, folded up in a resting position. 12.6. Now, attach the gargoyle to the front left stud on the main build. It should be placed at a 45 degree angle, with the sideways 1x1 circular plate at the front left. 13.1. Now we\u2019ll build the gargoyle\u2019s head! Place a light gray pair of minifigure binoculars in front of you. The binoculars are made up of two bars connected to each other. One end of each bar is thick and hollow. This hollow end can accept a bar. There is a cutout for a stud on one side of the binoculars. Put two silvertically claws, one in each hollow bar on the binoculars. These form the horizontallyns, and the binoculars form the face of the gargoyle. The horizontallyns should curve towards the stud cutout on the binoculars. 13.2. Attach the head assembly to the main build, attaching the cutout on the binoculars to the sideways 1x1 circular plate on the front left of the building, with the horizontallyns pointing up. 14.1. Place a dark gray 1x1 slope tile, with the thick side at the left, on the front stud on the rightmost column on top of the build. Place another, with the thick side at the front, on the leftmost stud on the back row on top of the build. 14.2. Place a dark gray 1x2 plate with rounded ends onto the 2x2 tile with a single stud on the top of the build. Attach it to this piece so it is centered on the piece, and is at a 45 degree angle to the rest of the build, with a stud at the front right and back left. 15. Attach the Batman minifigure to the previous piece. He should be standing overtically the gargoyle and looking to the front left. Congratulations! Now the Batman 1992 polybag is complete! Thank you",

        "instructions": "Instructions: Note for helpers: I have broken some of LEGO\u2019s original instructions into smaller steps, but I have kept the original base number. For example, step 5 is now steps 5.1 and 5.2. Side build - Tree branch with flowers. Open bag 1. Open group 1. 1.1. We will start with the base of the branch. Place a green 4x6 half circular plate in front of you, with the flat side at the back. 1.2. Place a dark brown 2x2 circular brick on the back row of the previous piece, centered horizontallyizontally, extending one stud to the back. 2. Place a green 4x6 half circular plate behind the first half circular plate, with the flat side at the front so the two half-circles make an entire circle. 3. Place a dark green 2x2 slope in front of the 2x2 circular brick, centered horizontallyizontally, sloping down to the front. Place another dark green 2x2 slope symmetricallyetrically behind the 2x2 circular brick. Place a dark green 2x2 slope to the left of the 2x2 circular brick, sloping down to the left. Place another dark green 2x2 slope symmetricallyetrically to the right of the 2x2 circular brick. 4. Place a light brown 4x4 circular plate on the previous pieces, centered verticallytically and horizontallyizontally. 5.1. Place a dark brown 2x2 circular plate with four upward arms on the previous piece, centered verticallytically and horizontallyizontally. 5.2. Place a dark brown 2x2 circular brick on the previous piece, centered verticallytically and horizontallyizontally. 6. Now we\u2019ll make the branch a bit taller by adding a trunk. Place a dark brown 2x2 circular brick in front of you and put a light brown 2x2 circular tile with a hole onto it. Rotate this assembly 90 degrees so the circular tile is sideways on the left. 7. Place a dark brown straight axle connector onto one end of a light gray 9L axle. Push the axle through the assembly from step 6 from the left. Push it in until the axle connector touches the circular tile from the previous step. 8.1. Slide the center axle hole of a dark brown 2x2 circular brick onto the right end of the axle until it attaches to the 2x2 circular brick from step 6. 8.2. Slide the center axle hole of a dark brown 2x2 circular plate with four upward arms onto the right end of the axle, with the arms at the left. Push it to the left until it connects to the previous piece. 9.1. Slide another dark brown 2x2 circular brick onto the axle like we did in step 8.1. 9.2. Slide a dark brown 2x2 circular plate onto the axle from the right, until it attaches to the previous piece. 10. Rotate the trunk 90 degrees so the trunk is pointing up and down and the axle connector is at the top. Push the axle through the center of the 2x2 circular brick from step 5, pushing down until it connects to the circular brick from step 5. 11.1. Orient a green 6x5 plant leaves so that the end with only a single stud is at the left, and attach this stud onto the rightmost upward arm on the bottom 2x2 circular plate with four upwards arms. The rest of the plant leaves should extend to the right. A parallel column of two studs should be at the far right. 11.2. Place a dark brown square robot arm onto the far left upward arm on the bottom 2x2 circular plate with four arms. Use the square part of the robot arm to attach it, not the clip. The clip should be up and to the left. Place another dark brown square robot onto the front upward arm on the top 2x2 circular plate with four arms. Use the square part of the arm again, and the clip should be up and to the front. Open group 2. 12. Now we\u2019ll start building a blue and yellow flower, so set the base of the branch aside for now. Place a white 2x2 circular plate with an octagonal bar farm around it in front of you. 13. Place an orange 1x1 circular plate onto each stud of the previous piece so it makes a square of studs. 14.1. Now we\u2019ll make petals! Place a white 1x1 plate with a verticallytical clip on one side in front of you, with the clip on the right. 14.2, Place a yellow 1x2 curved slope tile, horizontallyizontally long, on the previous piece, sloping down to the right, and extending one stud to the left. The cut out should be on the left. 14.3. Attach a petal to each diagonal bar using the clip. The slope tile should be on top. If you draw a line through two opposite petals, it should go through two diagonal corners of the 2x2 square of studs described in step 12. Hinge all the petals down so they lay flat. 15.1. Now we\u2019ll make some larger petals. Place a light blue 1x2 half cylinder slope onto a white 1x2 plate with a verticallytical clip on one long side, with the clip on your left and the slope verticallytically long, sloping up to the left. Repeat this three more times to create a total of four larger petals. 15.2. Keeping the clip at the left, flip a petal overtically so the slope is at the bottom. Attach it to the far right verticallytical bar on the flower. Hinge it 90 degrees counterclockwise so the plate with a clip is at the left and the slope is at the right. Repeat this for each larger petal, keeping the slope on the outside of the flower and the plate with a clip on the inside. Flip the flower overtically so its face is down. 16.1. Place a tan 1x2 plate with a bar on one long side in front of you, horizontallyizontally long, with the bar at the front. 16.2. Place a dark green 2x2 inverticallyted curved slope tile on the bottom of the previous piece, so it slopes up in the back. 16.3. Place a black 2x2 circular plate on the pieces from the previous step. Flip the assembly overtically and attach it to the flower, centered verticallytically and horizontallyizontally. Rotate the flower so its studs are sideways on the left, and the bar from step 16.1 is above the curved tile slope from step 16.2. 17. Set the base of the branch in front of you with the leaf on the right. Attach the bar from step 16.1 to the left robot arm on the branch.The flower should hang down off the branch. Rotate the flower so its face is angled up at about 45 degrees. Open group 3. 18. We\u2019re going to build another flower now. It\u2019s built the same way as the first, but using two shades of pink. Place a white 2x2 circular plate with an octagonal bar farm around it in front of you. 19. Place a yellow 1x1 circular plate with a flower pattern onto each stud of the previous piece so it makes a square of studs. 20.1. Now we\u2019ll make petals! Place a light purple 1x2 curved slope tile onto a white 1x1 plate with a verticallytical clip, with the clip on your right, and the slope horizontallyizontally long, sloping up to the left. Repeat this three more times to create a total of four small petals. 20.2. Attach a petal to each diagonal bar using the clip. The slope tile should be on top. If you draw a line through two opposite petals, it should go through two diagonal corners of the 2x2 square of studs described in step 12. Hinge all the petals down so they lay flat. 21.1. Now we\u2019ll make some larger petals. Place a pink 1x2 half cylinder slope onto a white 1x2 plate with a verticallytical clip on one long side, with the clip on your left and the slope verticallytically long, sloping up to the left. Repeat this three more times to create a total of four larger petals. 21.2. Keeping the clip at the left, flip a petal overtically so the slope is at the bottom.

The stacked pairs are light green, and the loose ones are dark green. There are both left and right wedge plates. 50.1. Now we\u2019ll start making the base for the stream that flows through the garden. Place a light green 2x3 right wedge plate, with the studs on the right and the wide part at the back, in front of the 1x1 flower plate on the back row of the base. To determine if a wedge plate is a \u201cleft\u201d or a \u201cright\u201d variety, place it horizontallyizontally long in front of you, with the studs in a row at the front. Whichevertically side is widest, left or right, is the variety of wedge plate it is! 50.2. Place a light green 2x3 left wedge plate, with the studs on the right and the wide part at the front, in front of the previous piece. Repeat the previous two pieces in front of this piece. You should now have a column of 12 studs, and the wedge side should make a point at the front, the middle and the back. 50.3. Place a dark green 2x3 right wedge plate, with the studs on the left and the wide part at the front, to the left of the back wedge plate from step 50.1.

Group 18 contains transparent 1x2 tiles with orange koi fish printed on them, group 19 contains transparent 1x2 tiles with white koi fish printed on them, and group 20 contains light gray 1x1 circular tiles and light gray 1x6 tiles. Now we will start adding the transparent blue tiles and plates which make up the water of the creek. There are koi fish in the stream! We\u2019ll build the water one row at a time, building each row from right to left. For the next few steps, we\u2019ll do things a little bit differently. Because all colors are transparent blue, we won\u2019t tell you which color to grab! All tiles will be placed horizontallyizontally long, so we won\u2019t describe the orientation. 63.1. The first row, from right to left, is two 1x2 tiles, a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile. The right edges of the first 12 rows of the stream are all even. 63.2. The second row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, and a 1x1 plate. 63.3. The third row, from right to left, is a 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish print, a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile. 63.4. The fourth row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish print, a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile. 63.4. The fifth row, from right to left, is a 1x2 tile and a 1x4 tile. 63.5. The sixth row, from right to left, is a 1x4 tile and a 1x2 tile. 63.6. The seventh row is exactly like the fifth row. The eighth row is exactly like the sixth row. The ninth row is another repeat of the fifth row. 63.7. The tenth row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile. Now the orientations start to change. Unless otherwise stated, consider all 1x2 tiles as horizontallyizontal. 64.1. The eleventh row, from right to left, is two 1x2 tiles, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile, and a 1x1 plate. The verticallytical 1x2 tile is even with the back of the other pieces. 64.2. The twelfth row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, a verticallytical 1x2 tile with a koi fish pattern, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, a verticallytical 1x2 tile and a 1x2 tile. The verticallytical tile is even with the back of the other pieces. 64.3. The thirteenth row is offset one stud to the left. This row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, and a 1x1 plate. 64.4. The fourteenth row, from right to left, is a verticallytical 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, and a 1x2 tile. 64.5. The fifteenth row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate between the right two tiles from the fourteenth row, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, and a verticallytical 1x2 tile. 64.6. The sixteenth row is a 1x1 plate between the left two tiles from the fifteenth row. Let\u2019s take a second to check out our stream so far. From right to left, the first six columns should be unbroken columns of twelve, fifteen, fifteen, fifteen, sixteen, and sixteen. The seventh column from the right should have a shorizontallyt column of three at the back and six at the front, with seven exposed studs between. The eighth column should be a partial column with a column of two, then a single. The stream now turns ninety degrees to the left. We\u2019ll start making this turn by working from the twelfth row of the stream, and working towards the front. Because the pieces aren\u2019t nicely horizontallyizontal anymore, we aren\u2019t able to just move in a row from left to right. 65.1. Now we will extend the twelfth row. From right to left, a 1x1 plate, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, and a 1x2 tile. Place a light gray 1x1 circular tile behind the left stud of the last piece of this row. 65.2. Extend the thirteenth row, from right to left, a 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, and a 1x2 tile. 65.3. Extend the fourteenth row, from right to left, a 1x2 tile, skip overtically the flower plate, and a verticallytical 1x2 tile. 65.4. Extend the fifteenth row, from right to left, a 1x2 tile, and a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish pattern. 65.5. Extend the sixteenth row, from right to left, a 1x1 plate, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, and two 1x2 tiles. 65.6. The seventeenth row is a brand new row which starts in front of the right 1x1 from the previous row. From right to left, it is a verticallytical 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, a verticallytical 1x2 tile, and a 1x2 tile. 65.7. The eighteenth row, from right to left, skip overtically the first tile from the previous step, a 1x1 plate, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile. 65.8. The nineteenth row is offset two studs to the left from the previous row and, from right to left, is a verticallytical 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with a white koi fish pattern, and a verticallytical 1x2 tile. 65.9. The twentieth row is a 1x2 tile between the two verticallytical tiles from the previous step. 65.10. The twenty-first row is two 1x2 tiles. 65.11. The twenty-second row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile. Now let\u2019s take a quick look at how the stream is shaping up. The stream should now have 22 rows, and there should be one row of exposed studs at the front of the base, and one at the back. Row 22 (at the front of the build) should have fourteen exposed studs to the left of it. Row 21 should have thirteen exposed studs to the left of it. Rows 12-15 and row 17 should be even with row 22. Rows 16 and rows 18- 20 should be even with row 21. 66.1. Extend the twenty-second row to the left with three 1x2 tiles. 66.2. Now, we are going to change things up and work from left to right in columns. Almost all of the tiles in these columns will be verticallytically long, so use that orientation unless stated otherwise. First, place a horizontallyizontal 1x2 tile behind the left tile from the previous piece so its left edge is even with the 1x1 flower plate behind it. Extend this column, from front to back, with three 1x2 tiles. The right edges of this column should all be even. 66.3. The next column to the right, from front to back, is three 1x2 tiles, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish, and a 1x2 tile. 66.4. The next column to the right, from front to back, is a horizontallyizontal 1x2 tile, four 1x2 tiles, and a light gray 1x1 circular tile. 66.5. The next column to the right, starting behind the horizontallyizontal tile from the previous step and going from front to back, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, skip overtically the 1x1 flower plate, a horizontallyizontal 1x2 tile, a 1x1 plate, and two horizontallyizontal 1x2 tiles. 66.6. The next column to the right, from front to back, is a 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish, a horizontallyizontal 1x2 tile, skip overtically the tile from the previous step, and a horizontallyizontal 1x2 tile. 66.7, Place a 1x2 tile behind the previous piece so the right edges are even. Place another behind the first. Hang on! We\u2019re almost done with the stream! Now, let\u2019s take stock of our creek again. Row 22 should have eight exposed studs to the left of it. Row 21 should only have seven. All of the other rows should be even with row 22. For the next few steps, we will be building columns from left to right. Again, most of the tiles in these columns will be verticallytically long, so use that orientation unless stated otherwise. 67.1. The first column we\u2019ll build is on the second column from the left on the base. From front to back, skipping overtically the front stud on the base, make a column of five 1x2 tiles. The front edges of all subsequent columns will be even with this one. 67.2. The second column, from front to back, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with a white koi fish, two 1x2 tiles, and a horizontallyizontally long light gray 1x6 tile which extends to the right. 67.3. The third column, from front to back, is a 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish, two 1x2 tiles, and a light gray 1x1 circular plate. 67.4. The fourth column, from front to back, is a horizontallyizontal 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile, a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, skip overtically the 1x1 flower plate, and a 1x2 tile. 67.5. The fifth column, from front to back, is four 1x2 tiles behind the tile from the previous step. 67.6. The sixth column, from front to back, is four 1x2 tiles, and a light gray 1x1 circular tile. 67.7. The last column, from front to back, is a 1x1 plate, skip overtically the tile and the 1x1 flower plate, and three 1x2 tiles. There should now be one exposed row of studs to the left of the stream, and one in front of it. The front and left edges of the stream should be unbroken lines of tiles and plates. Open group 21. 68.1. Now we\u2019ll build some water lilies for the stream. Place a green 2x2 dish in front of you, with the stud on top. 68.2. Place a purple five pointed leaf on the previous piece. 68.3. Place an orange 1x1 round tile with verticallytical ribs onto the stud inside the petals of the previous piece. That\u2019s one water lily complete! 68.4. Repeat steps 68.1-68.3 three more times to make a total of four water lilies. 68.5. Now we\u2019ll place the lilies. Starting on the back row of the stream, find the four studs which alternate left and right, with tiles on either side of them. Place one lilly on the second stud from the back. There should be a horizontallyizontal tile to the left and right of this lilly. 68.6. Now, feel straight in front of the previous lilly until you find another stud in the middle of the stream. This is right where the stream starts to turn left. Place a lilly on this stud. There should be a horizontallyizontal tile to the left and right of this lilly. 68.7. To place the next lilly, trace the left side of the verticallytical portion of the stream from back to front until the stream curves, then continue a little ways until you find a stud. Place a lilly on this stud. This should be in front of, and to the left of the previous lilly by a little bit. 68.8. The last lilly is on the front left portion of the stream. Find the two studs on the front row of the stream. Then find the column of two studs between them. Place the last lilly on the front stud. You can use the studs on the edge of the garden for reference. This lilly is on the sixth row from the front, and the fifth column from the left. Now we\u2019ve finished the stream! Open bag 5. Open group 22. 69.1. Now we\u2019ll start building up the garden behind and to the left of the stream. Place a dark brown 1x16 brick, horizontallyizontally long, on the second row from the back of the base so there is one exposed stud to the left of it. 69.2. Place a dark tan 3x3 right sloped wedge brick, with the studs on the left and the wide side at the front, to the right of the previous piece so the back edges are even. 69.3.

Place a light brown 1x2 plate with a clip on top of one stud, horizontallyizontally long with the clip at the right, behind the previous piece so the left edges are even. The bridge to cross the stream will attach to these clips. Open group 23. 71.1. Place a dark tan 2x2 slope brick, with the slope at the right, in front of the previous piece so the left edges are even. It should fit between the two 2x2 corner plates from step 69.5. 71.2. Place a dark tan 1x2 plate, verticallytically long, to the left of the previous piece. 71.3. Place a dark tan 2x2 double slope brick, with the slope at the front and the right, in front of the clip on the front 1x2 plate with a clip on top of one stud from step 70.1, so that it extends one stud to the right of it. 71.4.

Place a red 1x2 plate with a verticallytical clip on one side, with the studs down and the clip at the back, on the back row of anti-stud on the previous piece. Place another symmetricallyetrically in front of the first. Flip the assembly overtically so the tile is on top. 116.6. Repeat steps 116.4 and 116.5 three more times to make four bridge sections. 116.7. Attach the back clip of one bridge section to one of the tube assemblies, immediately to the right of the left bar connector. Attach the other bridge sections to the right of the first. The last one should be immediately to the left of the right bar connector. 116.7. Attach the other tube assembly onto the front clips of the bridge sections. The flat sides of the bar connectors on each end of the tubes should be on the top and bottom. You can rotate these while they\u2019re still attached to the tube. 116.8. Attach a red robot arm with a clip on each side to the front tube between the middle two bridge sections. The elbow of the arm is bent slightly, and the pointed side should point back towards the bridge sections. Repeat this symmetricallyetrically on the back side of the bridge. These will support the bridge railing. 116.9. Now we\u2019ll attach the bridge to the garden. Find the two clips on the left bank of the stream. These are at the verticallyy end of the stepping stone path. Attach the bars on the left side of the bridge to the two clips. Then, attach the other two bars on the bridge to the clips on the right side of the stream. Since the bridge is longer than the stream, you\u2019ll need to bend the tubes so the bridge arches overtically the stream! 117.1. Now we\u2019ll make the bridge rails. Place a red 8L tube, horizontallyizontally long, in front of you. 117.2. Place a red bar connector with a bar on one end, with the bar on the left, on the left end of the previous piece.

Find the four 1x1 flower plates in the stream on the left side of the garden. The first is on the third column from the left in front of the rocks. The second is on the sixth column from the left between a water lily and a lantern. The third is on the eleventh column from the right behind a lantern. The last one is on the fourteenth column from the left, to the right of a rock. Place one support on each of these 1x1 flower plates. Angle the supports so the flat faces are all parallel with the imaginary lines between the first and second flower plates, and the second, third, and fourth flower plates. 120.4. Now we will place the tall supports for the tea room. The tea room is placed at an angle on single studs. The first four supports will be placed in the stream. The first support goes on the stud which is in the stream behind the far left water lilly. 120.5. The second support goes on the first stud to the right of the front left water lilly. This is between the water lilly and the first lantern. 120.6. Continue to the right of the second support until you find a lantern (if you did not place the lanterns yet this will just be a stud). There should be two studs behind this lantern/stud. Place the third support on the first one. 120.7. Continue behind the second support until you find the stud, then move right. You will find a rock. Find the stud which is just behind and to the right of the rock. Place the last tall support on this stud. 120.5. Find the three 2x2 angled slope bricks behind the stream. The first is on the leftmost column in front of a tree. The second is to the right of the stack of 4x4 tiles with rounded corners. The third is just to the left of the two trees to the left of the bridge. Place a brown 1x1 brick on each of these pieces. 121. Now, rotate the garden 180 degrees so it is horizontallyizontally long and the bridge is closer to the front. Now, we\u2019ll attach the tea room to the support we placed. Place the tea room in front of you, with the entry at the front right. Rotate it so it is in line with the supports from the previous two steps and attach it to them. It should be at close to a 45 degree angle to the rest of the garden. When placed, it should overticallyhang the supports by half a stud on all four sides. Once the tea room is attached, carefully rotate the supports so their flat faces are parallel to the walls of the tea room. The 4x4 tiles with rounded corners should lead up to the entryway like a staircase. Open bag 10. Sub-build 1 - First deciduous tree Open group 43. 122.1.
