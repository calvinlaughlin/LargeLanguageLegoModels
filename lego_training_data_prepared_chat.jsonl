Place it in front of you with the long axis running horizontally.\\n2. Locate one black 4x4 plate and two medium gray 1x2 grille tiles. Place the 4x4 plate on the 2x12 plate,\\nhorizontally centered. Now place one grille tile vertically on the immediate left of the 4x4 plate, place the\\nother grill tile symmetrically on the right. This is the base and bottom of the car!\\n3. Locate two black 2x2 plates. Flip your structure upside-down, keeping the same overall horizontal\\norientation. Place each 2x2 plate on the 2x12 plate, skipping one stud in from each side, symmetrically.\\n4. Locate four yellow pegs and four medium gray 2x2 plates with pin holes. Flip your structure so the studs\\nare upright. Place each of the pegs into each of the plates\u2019 pin holes. Now put two plates vertically\\ntogether and place them to the immediate left of the left grille tile, with one peg facing front and one facing\\nback, leaving a one stud overhang on the front and back. Symmetrically do the same on the immediate\\nright side of the right grille tile. These are the axles that will hold the wheels.\\n5. Locate two black 2x2 plates. Place each on the far right and far left, overhanging one stud on either\\nside horizontally.\\n6. Locate one tan 2x2 modified tile with two studs and one medium gray 2x10 plate. Place the tan 2x2\\nplate skipping one stud in from the left and with the two vertical studs facing right. Now place the 2x10\\nplate to the immediate right of the 2x2 plate. This tan plate signifies the left side of the build as the front of\\nthe car!\\n7. Locate two yellow 2x4 plates and four medium gray 1x2 plates with rounded edges. Horizontally place\\nthe yellow 2x4 plate on the front-center of the build, and then symmetrically on the back-center. Now\\nhorizontally place each rounded piece onto each of the four plates with attached pegs.\\n8. Locate two black 2x2 half brick-half plates with attached arches. Horizontally place these onto the two\\nfar-right rounded plates with the arches facing the outer edges. The pieces will overhang by two horizontal\\nstuds.\\n9. Locate one medium gray 4x6 plate. Place this, with the long axis running horizontally, onto the center of\\nthe build, leaving four exposed studs on the front and back of the yellow 2x4 plates underneath.\\n10. Locate one 1x4 yellow plate and one white 2x2 stair piece with a total of 6 studs. Place the 1x4 yellow\\nplate on the right edge of the previously placed 4x6 medium gray plate, vertically. Now place the 2x2 white\\nstair piece onto the tan 2x2 modified tile with two studs at the edge and with the thicker step of the stair\\nattached to the tan studs. Note that the two studs sticking out of the stair piece are facing left.\\n11. Locate two yellow 1x2 bricks and four 1x2 bricks with slopes. Along the four yellow exposed studs\\nalong the front-center and back-center of the build, place horizontally, from left to right, an upward slope\\nfacing left, followed by the regular 1x2 brick, followed by another upward slope but facing right.\\n12. Locate two more black 2x2 half brick-half plates with attached arches. Place each onto the left\\nrounded plates with each arch facing the outside of the build.\\n13. Locate one medium gray steering wheel and two tan 2x2 bricks with a rounded top/curved slope and\\ntwo studs on the edge. Vertically place both tan 2x2 bricks to the immediate right of the white stair piece,\\nside by side with the slopes facing left and the two studs facing right. Now place the steering wheel to the\\nimmediate right of the two sloped-bricks, centered-vertically, with the back of the steering wheel facing left.\\n14. Locate one yellow 1x1 flat tile and one medium gray 1x1 headlight brick with one stud on the top and\\none stud on a side. Place the yellow 1x1 tile on the side stud and align the square edges perfectly.\\n15. Locate a black 1x6 plate and place it down separately to the build with its long axis running\\nhorizontally. Place the previously assembled headlight brick from step 14 onto the second stud from the\\nleft on the black 1x6 plate. Ensure that the yellow 1x1 tile on the side of the headlight brick is facing front.\\n16. Locate one yellow 2x2 L corner brick and one regular yellow 2x2 brick. Place the L corner brick to the\\nimmediate right of the headlight brick so that, together, both pieces form a square shape. To the\\nimmediate right of the L brick, place the regular 2x2 brick, leaving one stud exposed on the right.\\n17. Locate one yellow 1x2 brick and one medium gray 1x2 brick with two studs on top and two stud\\nindentations on a side. Place the regular yellow 1x2 brick onto the headlight brick and the L brick\\nhorizontally. Now place the gray 1x2 brick with two indentations to the immediate right of the yellow brick,\\nhorizontally and with the indentations facing you.\\n18. Locate one yellow 1x4 flat tile and one black peg. Place the yellow 1x4 tile horizontally on top of the\\nprevious two bricks. Now place the peg into the left indentation of the gray brick from the last step.\\n19.1. Locate two yellow 1x1x2 bricks with two studs on a side and two transparent red round 1x1 tiles.\\nPlace, symmetrically and vertically, each of the yellow bricks on either side of the 1x6 plate, leaving no\\nmore studs from that plate exposed and ensuring that the top stud is facing the ceiling and the two side\\nstuds are facing you. Now place each transparent red round tile on the front upper stud on each previously\\nplaced brick.\\n19.2. Locate two transparent orange 1x1 round tiles. Place the transparent orange round tiles on the sidebottom studs under the red round tiles and on the same 1x1x2 bricks in the previous step.\\n20. Locate one long medium gray L bench-like panel. Rotate the build 180 degrees so that the previous\\nside that was facing you is now facing away from you. Now place the panel horizontally on top of the four\\nexposed studs on the side of the build that is facing you so that the wall is facing back.\\n21. Take this structure and attach this to the rear of the car, which should be the right of the build if the car\\nis still running horizontally. The side of the previously built structure with the long gray L panel should be\\nfacing left toward the front of the car and align with the two studs at the right edge of the 2x6 plate in the\\nrear of the car. This structure should also attach to the two exposed studs at the far-most right, so in total,\\nit is attached to the main build by four studs.\\n22. Locate two yellow 1x8 plates, two yellow 1x4 plates and two yellow, 1x1 plates. Assemble all of these\\npieces before attaching it to the main build. Start with the 1x8 plate running horizontally. Place the 1x1\\nplate underneath the 1x8 plate at the far-most right stud. Then horizontally place the 1x4 on top of the 1x8\\nplate at the far-most right. Repeat this with the other 1x8, 1x1, and 1x4 plates located in this step. Now\\nplace each of these assemblies on the main build horizontally and symmetrically to one another on the\\nfront and back. The 1x4 plates should face the rear of the car or the right of the build, leaving four exposed\\nstuds on the 1x8 plate facing the front of the car. They should go on the right side of the build and the 1x1\\nplate will fit into the gap between the wheel axle and the structure from step 21.\\n23. Locate two long yellow 1x4 flat tiles. Place each horizontally and symmetrically to one another on the\\nfour studs exposed on the rear of the car leaving one stud of the previous 1x4 plates exposed. These long\\ntiles should align perfectly with the far-right of the build.\\n24. Locate two yellow 1x2 slope pieces. On the same front and back long sides of the car, place each\\nslope downward, symmetrically to one another, facing inward toward the inside of the car, and to the\\nimmediate left of the single exposed studs from both 1x4 plates near the rear of the car.\\n25. Locate one medium gray 1x4 plate and one tan 1x2 brick with two bumps on its sides. Vertically place\\nthe 1x4 plate on top of the two vertical studs to the left of the 2x2 bricks with rounded top/curved slopes\\nfrom step 13. Now vertically place the bumpy 1x2 brick to the left of the 1x4 plate just placed, leaving a\\nsmall gap where the slopes are and two vertical studs to the left of the bumpy brick exposed.\\n26. Locate two yellow 2x3 plates. Horizontally and symmetrically, place each on the front and back long\\nsides of the car. These plates should be touching both front-of-car arches. Align these perfectly and\\nhorizontally so that no part of this piece overhangs. Vertically, there will be two studs between the two\\npieces.\\n27. Locate four yellow 1x1 plates. Start by connecting two of them and placing this to the immediate left of\\nthe step 24 1x2 downward slope pieces in the center of a long side of the car. Repeat this symmetrically\\nby connecting the other two 1x1 plates and placing them to the left of the other 1x2 downward slope on\\nthe other long side.\\n28. Locate one medium gray 1x6 tile, one medium gray 2x3 plate, and one medium gray 1x2 brick with\\ntwo studs at the top and two studs on a side. Vertically and symmetrically place the 1x6 tile on the far\u2013\\nmost left and very front of the car, leaving the same amount of space overhanging on the front and back.\\nNow place the 2x3 plate horizontally to the immediate left of the back of the steering wheel. Now place the\\n1x2 brick to the immediate left of the 2x3 plate, leaving the two side studs of the brick facing left.\\n29. Locate two yellow 1x2 tiles, two yellow 1x4 plates, and two yellow 1x2 plates. Horizontally and\\nsymmetrically to both front and back long sides of the car, place the 1x2 flat tile immediately next to and\\ntouching the two left tire arches, aligning its left edge to the pieces underneath and leaving no overhang.\\nTo the immediate right of the 1x2 tiles, horizontally place the 1x2 plates. Now to fill in the two long\\nhorizontal gaps in the front of the car, horizontally and symmetrically place each 1x4 plate on the next\\nstuds inward from the previously placed 1x2 tiles and plates.\\n30. Locate one black 1x4 window frame. Vertically place this, three studs to the right of the steering wheel,\\naligning the frame onto the four raised studs on a previous yellow 1x4 plate. You have just built a\\nseparation between the space for the driver and the trunk!\\n31. Just a heads up that this step will be repeated! Locate one yellow 1x2 tile, one yellow 1x1 plate, one\\ntransparent 1x2x4 window, and one 1x1x2 brick with two studs on a side. Assemble these new pieces\\nbefore attaching this to the main build. To start, place the 1x1 plate underneath the 1x1 brick with side\\nstuds. Now connect this to the window piece horizontally with the two side studs of the brick and the two\\nholes of the window. Now place the 1x2 tile onto the other side of the window, perfectly aligning the two\\nstuds. To attach this structure to the car, place this on the stud in front of the step 20 window frame. This\\nshould be on the front long side of the car with the brick side of the window facing left and the tile side of\\nthe window facing right. Ensure that the window is not facing inward towards the car.\\n32. Repeat the previous step but place the window structure on the back long side. This is really starting to\\nfeel like a car!\\n33. Locate a yellow 1x6 tile. Vertically place this on top of the previously placed black 1x4 frame, perfectly\\naligning the edges and leaving no overhang.\\n34. Locate a medium gray 1x2 rounded plate. Do not place or attach this piece yet.\\n35. Locate two yellow 2x2 stair pieces with two studs on a side. Place both yellow stairs side by side\\nsymmetrically with the highest stair and all four side studs facing you. Now connect both 2x2 pieces with\\nthe 1x2 rounded plate on the lowest stair in the center, leaving one stud exposed on either side of the\\nlowest steps.\\n36. Locate two yellow 2x2 L corner plates with three studs each. Orient one as the braille letter \u201cf\u201d then\\nplace it on the back-left stud. Now orient the other as the braille letter \u201cd\u201d then place it on the back-right\\nstud. Ensure that this 2x6 rectangular structure has the long axis running horizontally.\\n37. Locate two yellow 1x2 tiles with one stud on top. Place the two tiles side by side vertically and\\nsymmetrically in the center, leaving four 2x2 studs exposed on either sides.\\n38. Locate two yellow and black 2x2 tiles with one stud and two printed circles at one of the edges. Place\\neach 2x2 tile on either side of the previously placed 1x2 tiles, perfectly forming a rectangle with no\\noverhang or exposed studs from underneath. Ensure that the two printed circles on the left tile face the left\\nand the two printed circles on the right face the right.\\n39. Locate one black 2x3 tile (this tile may have had a sticker placed on it by a helper previously) and two\\ntransparent 1x1 circle tiles. Symmetrically place each 1x1 circle on each stud from the previous yellow and\\nblack 2x2 tiles with printed circles. In between the two transparent circle tiles, place the black 2x3 tile\\nhorizontally and in the center.\\n40. Locate two yellow 1x1 plates. Flip this structure upside down with the long axis running horizontally still\\nand the same side facing front and back still. Symmetrically place each 1x1 plate on the far-back-left and\\nfar-back-right. \\n41. Flip this structure back around so that the sides that were facing front and back remain the same. If\\nyou haven\u2019t already, locate the car grille sticker displaying the word \u201cDEFENDER\u201d in the center with a\\nprinted green bumper sticker on the bottom right corner reading \u201cLAND-ROVER.\u201d Place this sticker onto\\nthe black 2x3 tile or move onto the next step if this was already done.\\n42. Attach this structure to the side studs facing left on the main build, while ensuring the words are\\nupright. The four side studs should face up, forming a 5x4 on the top hood of the car. This is really coming\\ntogether!\\n43. Locate one medium gray 1x4 plate and two circle pieces with small sticks attached. Place each of the\\ntwo circles with sticks to the immediate left of each of the two 1x1 plates in the center-long-sides of the\\ncar. Have the long parts of the pieces stick outward of the car. You have just built part of the side mirrors!\\nNow vertically place the 1x4 plate in between the two circle-and-stick pieces. This is the base for the large\\ncar windshield!\\n44. Locate a large 1x6 transparent window panel with a downward slope. Place the window on top of all\\nthree pieces placed in the previous step. Ensure that the slope is facing the left toward the front of the car.\\n45. Locate one yellow 1x2 tile, one yellow 1x3 left wing/angle plate with three studs, one yellow 1x3 right\\nwing plate with three studs, one yellow 2x3 plate, and two yellow 1x1 quarter circle tiles. Now let\u2019s build\\nthe hood of the car! Start by creating a trapezoid shape onto the immediate left of the car windshield using\\nthe 2x3 plate and the two 2x3 wing/angle plates. The longest side of the trapezoid should align with the\\nbottom edge/slope of the windshield and the 2x3 plate should be horizontal. Now place the 1x2 tile\\nvertically to the immediate left of the 2x3 plate. Then place the quarter circle tiles in front and behind that\\npiece with the rounded corners facing outward. To reiterate, ensure that the hood has a cohesive\\ntrapezoid shape with rounded corners at the very front of the car.\\n46. Locate a yellow 2x4 tile, a yellow 1x2 tile, and two yellow 1x1 quarter circle tiles. To the immediate\\nright of the three pieces just placed, repeat the same build by vertically placing the 1x2 tile along with the\\ntwo 1x1 rounded quarter circles behind and in front of the 1x2. Now to the immediate right of these pieces,\\nvertically place the 2x4 tile. You have just created layers that give the illusion of a curved and raised hood!\\n47. Locate two black 1x1 plates with hooks on one end. To complete the side mirrors, attach these with\\nthe singular studs facing the front of the car and by connecting the hook onto the top side of the previously\\nplaced rods that stick out from underneath the sides of the windshield.\\n48. Locate five black tires and five black wheel rims with pin holes. Insert all five rims into the outer tires\\nand attach four wheels to the pegs under the four arches. Now place the fifth tire on the rear of the car on\\nthe right of the build and connect it with the peg already placed from step 18. Now all you need is the roof!\\n49. Locate one yellow 2x4 plate. Place it down on your surface vertically and do not attach it to anything\\nyet.\\n50. Locate one white 4x4 arch/bridge plate. Vertically place this piece on top of the 2x4 plate from the last\\nstep, leaving 1x4 studs exposed on the left. These pieces should be connected by only four studs and the\\n4x4 arch should be to the right of and covering half of the 2x4 plate.\\n51. Locate one white 4x4 downward slope with only four studs. Place this vertically with the four studs on\\nthe edge facing the right and the slope facing the left. Align the four studs with the four exposed studs from\\nthe last step on the bottom 2x4 plate. This connects both 4x4 pieces to create the base of the roof!\\n52. Locate one yellow 1x4 plate. Flip over the roof while ensuring the slope is still facing left and the arch\\nis still on the right. Now vertically place the 1x4 plate on the far-right, filling the gap in the arch piece.\\n53. Locate two yellow 1x4 plates and two yellow 1x2 plates. Symmetrically and horizontally place each\\n1x4 plate on the sides facing front and back, aligning the edges all the way to the right and leaving no\\noverhang. Now symmetrically and horizontally place each 1x2 plate on the second stud to the left,\\nskipping over one stud. You are so close to finishing! You got this!\\n54. Locate two black 1x6 plates. Flip over the roof so that the slope is still facing the left. Place each 1x6\\nplate all the way to each edge/side facing front and back, symmetrically, horizontally, leaving 2x4 studs in\\nbetween the two 1x6 plates exposed and leaving 1x4 studs all the way to the right of the roof exposed.\\n55. Locate two black 3x6 rectangular pipe racks with four studs. Vertically place these side by side, lining\\nup each of the studs of the roof rack to the previously placed 1x6 plates. You have just finished the roof!\\n56. Last step! Attach the roof to the top of the main build with the slope facing left, ensuring that it is facing\\nthe same way as the downward slope of the windshield, the layered hood, and the car grille with a sticker.\\nCongratulations! Now the Land Rover Classic Defender is complete! The next page shows how you can\\nlift the roof off and place the driver inside the car and to the right of the windshield and steering wheel.\\nThe page after shows the completed Land Rover, with the driver behind the wheel and the roof placed\\nback on.\\nThank you so much for building this set!']"}]}

This is the slushy cup!\\n85. Now for the lid! Locate a clear 4x4 dome with recessed top. Place this on top of the slushy cup.\\nLocate a transparent 1x1 round tile with a tube on top. Place this on the recessed stud of the previous\\npiece.\\n86. Locate a white cylinder with clip (this piece kind of looks like a minifigure arm). Place this on top of the\\nprevious piece, with the clip pointing upwards.\\n87. Locate a white cylinder with a bar (this piece looks like the previous piece, but with a bar instead of a\\nclip). Clip the bar into the clip from the previous piece. This piece should hinge on the previous piece.\\nHinge it down to about a 90 degree angle. This forms the bendy straw on the slushy cup!\\n88. Locate a white 2x2 tile with a peg on top. Place this on the bottom of the slushy cup, through a hole in\\nthe middle of the white circular plate. Locate a light gray 2x2 brick with two hinge fingers on one side.\\nPlace this on the bottom of the previous piece.\\n89. Place the van in front of you again, with the windshield to your right. Attach the hinged brick from the\\nprevious step to the hinged plate from step 79. The fingers of the hinged brick on the slushy should point\\ndown, and the slushy straw should be on your right. The hinge fingers should click into the hinge plate on\\ntop of the van, then the slushy cup can tilt up and down in increments! Point it upwards at a slight angle\\nabove the roof of the van.\\n90. Now we build the wheels! Locate the four black rubber tires and four gray wheels. Press the wheels\\ninto the tires. There is a spoke pattern on one side of the wheels, and a hollow side on the other side. The\\nspoke side points outwards. Place one wheel on each of the wheel pegs of the van.\\nCongratulations! Now the van is complete! The next page shows how you can lift the roof off of the\\ndriver\u2019s seat and place the slushy vendor inside! The page after shows the completed van, with the\\nvendor inside and the little girl outside.\\nThank you so much for building this set!']"}]}

Place a medium blue 2x2\\ntile to the right and back, so in the second and third row from the front. Most parts of the second and third\\nrow from the front should now be covered by tiles (except for five studs).\\nOpen group 3 which contains the pieces for steps 11-13. The dark azure 1x1 plate from step 13.3 is in a\\nseparate sub-bag.\\n11. Locate three black 1x6 tiles and cover the front row with them horizontally.\\n12. Locate two white cloud pieces with three studs on top. Place one of them horizontally onto the front\\nwhite 2x2 tile modified with two studs so that it is mainly above the second and third row from the front\\n(the two studs from the tile modified should go into the back row of the cloud). Place the other cloud\\nhorizontally onto the white 2x2 tile modified with two studs further back so that it is mainly above the sixth\\nand seventh row from the back (the two studs from the tile modified should go into the front row of the\\ncloud).\\n13. In this step consisting of three sub-steps you are building the small plane with a red rudder which is\\nflying across the scene.\\n13.1 Locate a white 2x2 corner plate and orient it as if it were the braille letter H (so with the missing stud\\nin the back right). Place a medium nougat (medium brown, mix of brown and orange) 1x1 plate onto the\\nfront right stud of the previous piece.\\n13.2 Place a red 1x1 slope onto the previous piece, slope to the left. Locate a white 1x2 curved slope and\\norient it horizontally, slope to the left and place it to the left.\\n13.3 Locate a dark azure (medium blue, mix of cyan and blue) 1x1 plate from a separate bag from group\\n3.

The plane will be\\nattached at the un-tiled single stud in the third row from the front using the dark azure 1x1 plate of the\\nplane. Orient the plane so that the headlight brick is upright again, headlight to the front, with the dark\\nazure 1x1 plate at the bottom. Like this, place the plane onto the described single stud in the third row\\nfrom the front. The plane will be on its side, flying to the left, its top pointing towards you. What is the front\\nof the main piece now will later be the top of the postcard, so the plane will be flying rightwards in the\\nupper left corner of the upright standing postcard. By the way, the aircraft is presumably one of the\\nAustralian airline Qantas, whose trademark is the red rudder.\\nYou have successfully finished building bag 1 creating the upright standing background of the scene\\nwhich consists of some dark orange desert hills, the blue sky, two large white clouds and a flying plane.\\nSet this piece aside for now.\\nOpen bag 2 and group 4 which contains the pieces for steps 14-19.\\nIn this bag, you\u2019ll build the base of the upright standing postcard, including a gray windmill, a tiny wooden\\noutside toilet, a wooden shed with an aluminum roof as well as a large eucalyptus tree.\\n14. Locate a dark orange 4x6 plate and orient it horizontally.\\n15. Locate two black 1x2 bricks and two black 1x2x2 brick modifieds with four side studs. Place a black\\n1x2 brick horizontally onto a black 1x2x2 brick modified with side studs, side studs pointing to the back.\\nRotate the piece you just built by 90\u00b0 onto its front so the 2x2 side studs point to the top and the 1x2 top\\nstuds point to the front. Place this piece below the dark orange 4x6 plate from the previous step so that\\nthe right column of side studs of the current piece attach to the backmost studs of the leftmost column of\\nthe plate. The left column of the current piece should protrude to the left of the plate and the current piece\\nshould be flush with the plate at the back. Repeat symmetrically at the right.\\n16. Locate two black 1x6 plates and put them on top of each other horizontally. Rotate the plates by 90\u00b0\\nonto their front so that their studs point to the front. Attach them from the front to the front of the main\\npiece, centered horizontally. The plates should now be hidden below the dark orange 4x6 plate (when\\nviewed from above).\\n17. Locate two black 1x6 plates and two black 1x6 tiles. Put a black 1x6 tile onto a black 1x6 plate\\nhorizontally. Rotate the piece you just built by 90\u00b0 onto its front so that the smooth part of the tile points to\\nthe front. Attach this piece to the front of the main piece similarly to and in line with the piece from the\\nprevious step, but to its left so it is connected to the main piece by the single exposed stud of the 1x2\\nbrick from step 15 and overhanging to the left. Repeat symmetrically to the right.\\n18. Locate two black 1x2 bricks and two black 1x2x2 brick modifieds with side studs. Place a black 1x2\\nbrick horizontally onto a black 1x2x2 brick modified with side studs, side studs pointing to the back.\\nRotate the piece you just built by 90\u00b0 onto its front so the 2x2 side studs point to the top and the 1x2 top\\nstuds point to the front. Attach the current piece to the left piece from the previous step from the back as\\nfar left as possible without overhanging. This piece should then be attached and oriented similarly to the\\ntwo identically built pieces further in the center of the main piece (which are half-hidden by the dark\\norange 4x6 plate). Repeat symmetrically to the right.\\n19. Locate two dark orange 4x6 plates. Orient them horizontally and place one of them to the left of the\\ndark orange 4x6 plate from step 14. Repeat symmetrically to the right. With this you have finished the\\nbase of the standing postcard.\\nOpen group 5 which contains the pieces for steps 20-24. The medium nougat 1x1 plate from step 21 is in\\na separate sub-bag. For step 20 you will need the separate flower plate group 1 bag.\\n20. Place a light bluish gray 1x1 round plate at the back right corner (pay attention that you are not using\\nthe round plate with a hole in its stud!). Locate three green 1x1 round plates with flower edges from the\\nseparate flower plate group 1 bag. Place a green flower plate to the left. Place a tan 1x1 slope to the left,\\nslope to the right. Place a green flower plate to the front. Place a trans-light blue 1x2 tile horizontally to\\nthe right. Place a green flower plate to the front as far right as possible. Place a trans-light blue 1x2 tile\\nhorizontally to the left. The back right 3x3 studs of the base should be covered now.\\n21. Place a medium nougat 1x1 plate from a separate bag from group 5 on top of a tan 1x1 plate. Place\\nthe piece you just made to the left of the slope in the back row. Place a tan 1x1 slope to the left, slope to\\nthe left. Place a tan 1x1 slope, slope to the front, skipping one row in front of the stacked 1x1 plates, so in\\nthe second row from the front, left of the trans-light blue 1x2 tile.\\n22. In this step consisting of three sub-steps you are building part of the base of the eucalyptus tree.\\n22.1 Locate a tan 1x3x3 arch and orient it horizontally, the base of the arch to the left. Place a tan 1x1\\nplate onto the single leftmost stud of the previous piece.\\n22.2 Locate a light bluish gray 2x2-1x2 centered bracket and put it onto the two rightmost studs of the\\narch, 2x2 anti-studs to the back.\\n22.3 Place a sand green 1x3 plate horizontally onto the previous piece overhanging one stud to the right.\\nPlace the piece you just built onto the stacked 1x1 plates in the back row of the main piece, the arch\\nextending to the right.\\n23. Locate a tan 1x3x3 arch and orient it vertically, the base of the arch to the back. Place a tan 1x1 brick\\nonto the single backmost stud of the previous piece. Place the piece you just built to the front of the base\\nof the arch from the previous step, the arch extending to the front. If placed correctly, the top of the arch\\nfrom this step should form a plane surface of size 1x4 with the leftmost stud of the arch of the previous\\nstep. The two arches are the base of the eucalyptus tree.\\n24. Place a light bluish gray 1x4 plate vertically onto the aforementioned space on top of the two arches\\nwhich is in the fourth column from the right. Place a dark bluish gray 1x1 round plate with a hole in its stud\\nonto the front right stud of the main piece.\\nOpen group 6 which contains the pieces for steps 25-29. The dark orange 1x1 round plates from steps 26\\nand 27, the reddish brown 1x1 brick from step 28, and the medium nougat 1x1 plate from step 29 are in a\\nseparate sub-bag. For step 26 you will need the separate flower plate group 1 bag.\\n25. Make a piece. Locate a light bluish gray bar with 1x1 round plate and place a light bluish gray 1x1\\nround plate on top of it. Extend the bar of the previous piece with a dark bluish gray candle by inserting\\nthe bar into the opening of the candle piece. Rotate the piece you just built upright so that the thin side of\\nthe candle piece is at the bottom and the stud of the 1x1 round plate points to the front. Insert the piece\\nlike this into the dark bluish gray 1x1 round plate in the front right from the previous step. This is the pole\\nof the traffic sign warning about kangaroos.\\n26. Place a light bluish gray 1x1 round plate to the left of the previous piece, skipping two columns, so in\\nthe fourth column from the right. Place a dark orange 1x1 round plate from a separate bag from group 6\\nto the left of the previous piece, skipping two columns again, so in the seventh column from the right (Fun\\nfact: Since this piece has the same color as the plate below, it is hard to distinguish visually, which is why\\nLEGO deliberately draws attention to the piece using a callout - something that\u2019s not necessary in these\\nwritten instructions). Place a light bluish gray 1x1 round plate to the back and to the right of the previous\\npiece. Locate two green 1x1 round plates with flower edges from the separate flower plate group 1 bag.\\nPlace a green flower plate to the right. Place a trans-light blue 1x2 tile horizontally to the back, extending\\nto the left, so behind the last two pieces to the left of the arch piece from step 23. Place a green flower\\nplate to the back of the left column of the previous piece.\\n27. Place a dark bluish gray 1x1 round brick to the left of the previous piece. Place a dark bluish gray 1x1\\nround tile on top of the previous piece. Place a medium nougat 1x4 plate horizontally to the left. Place a\\ndark orange 1x1 round plate from a separate bag from group 6 to the left.\\n28. Locate two medium nougat 1x1 bricks and place one of them onto the left and one of them onto the\\nright end of the medium nougat 1x4 plate from the previous step, leaving two free studs in between.\\nLocate a reddish brown 1x1 brick from a separate bag from group 6 and apply the sticker number 3 to its\\nfront side. The sticker shows a wooden texture. Place the brick onto the second stud from the right of the\\nsame just mentioned medium nougat 1x4 plate from the previous step, sticker pointing to the front.\\n29. Locate a medium nougat 1x1 plate from a separate bag from group 6 and put two trans-brown 1x1\\nplates on top of it. Place the piece you just built left of the previous piece. All four studs of the medium\\nnougat 1x4 plate from step 27 should be covered now.\\nOpen group 7 which contains the pieces for steps 30-35. For steps 33, 34, and 35 you will need the\\nseparate flower plate group 1 bag.\\n30. Place a medium nougat 1x4 plate horizontally onto the four level studs in the back row from the last\\ntwo steps. The plate should be exactly above the similar plate from step 27. Place a reddish brown 1x2\\ntile horizontally to the front, centered horizontally in relation to the previous piece.\\n31. Locate two light bluish gray telescopes as well as two dark bluish gray 1x1 slopes. Orient a telescope\\nupright with the stud pointing to the top and place one of the slopes onto it, slope to the front. Place the\\npiece you just built to the right of the reddish brown 1x2 tile from the previous step. Repeat symmetrically\\nto the left. These are the supporting pillars of the shed roof. Place a dark orange 1x1 round plate in front\\nof the previous piece.\\n32. Locate two dark bluish gray 1x2 hinge bricks as well as two light bluish gray 2x2 hinge plates. Make\\ntwo similar pieces. Orient a hinge brick horizontally so that it is open to the front and clip one of the hinge\\nplates onto it, hinge to the back. Place a metallic silver 1x2 grille tile vertically onto the left column of the\\nhinge plate. Place another metallic silver 1x2 grille tile vertically to the right. Place the piece you just built\\nonto the leftmost studs of the medium nougat 1x4 plate from step 30 in the back row, so that the hinge\\nplate extends to the front. Repeat symmetrically to the right. Then, tilt the two pieces you just placed\\ndownwards, so that they slope forward and touch the two slopes located on the telescopes. You just built\\nthe aluminum roof of the shed.\\n33. Locate four green 1x1 round plates with flower edges from the separate flower plate group 1 bag.\\nPlace a green flower plate at the back left corner of the main piece. Place a dark bluish gray 2x2 tile\\nmodified with two studs to the right, extending to the front, with the two studs at the back. Place a dark\\norange 1x1 round plate to the front of the left column of the previous piece. Place a green flower plate in\\nthe back row, fourth column from the left. Place another green flower plate to the right and to the front of\\nthe previous piece. Place another green flower plate to the right and to the back of the previous piece.\\nThe last three flower pieces should frame a free stud in the back row, fifth column from the left.\\n34. Locate a light bluish gray 1x2 bracket with two side studs sticking up and place it horizontally onto the\\ndark bluish gray 2x2 tile modified with two studs from the previous step, side studs to the front. Insert a\\ntan bar with three prongs with the bar end into the flower plate to the right. Insert another tan bar with\\nthree prongs into the flower plate in the second row from the front, fifth column from the right (which you\\nplaced much earlier, in step 26). Locate four green 1x1 round plates with flower edges from the separate\\nflower plate group 1 bag. Place three green flower plates in the front row, first, third, and sixth column\\nfrom the left. Place another green flower plate in the second row from the front, leftmost column.\\n35. Locate three magenta 1x1 round plates with flower edges (Note, that these are not in the separate\\nflower plate group 1, but in the bag for group 7, instead!). Place one of each onto a green flower plate on\\nthe main piece, from the left and from the front: first column and second row, third column and first row,\\nfifth column and third row. Locate four tan bars with three prongs as well as four green 1x1 round plates\\nwith flower edges from the separate flower plate group 1 bag. Make four similar pieces, each by sticking\\none of the green flower plates to the longest one of the prongs of the tan bars (NOT to the bar!). The\\npieces you just built will be inserted into green flower plates on the main piece as you did in the step\\nbefore. Insert one of each into the flower plates in the back row, first column, sixth column, and thirteenth\\ncolumn from the left, as well as in the front row, sixth column from the left.\\nOpen group 8 which contains the pieces for steps 36-44.\\n36. Build a sub-piece - the windmill. Locate a light bluish gray 1x1 technic brick with a hole, a light bluish\\ngray 1x2 plate modified with long stud receptacle (looks like a 1x2 plate with an elongated triangle on one\\nof its long sides, the tip of the triangle being an anti-stud), a light bluish gray bar with a 1x1 round plate,\\nand a dark bluish gray engine with 10 blades. Place the technic brick onto the 1x1 round plate of the gray\\nbar, bar to the left and brick hole to the front and back. Orient the 1x2 plate modified with long stud\\nreceptacle upright so that the stud receptacle points to the bottom and the two studs are at the top and\\npoint to the front. Place it like that onto the top stud of the technic brick. Insert the technic pin of the\\nengine with 10 blades from the front into the hole of the technic brick. The windmill is upside down,\\ncurrently, so rotate it right side up, the blades still pointing to the front.\\nConnect the windmill to the main piece by placing its bottom from the front to the two side studs sticking\\nup of the light bluish gray 1x2 bracket in the back left corner area.\\n37. Place a dark bluish gray 1x1 slope on top of a reddish brown 1x1 brick, slope to the back. Apply\\nsticker number 4 to the front of the brick. The sticker shows a wooden door with a heart shaped hole in it.\\nYou just built a small wooden outside toilet. Place it in front and right of the windmill, touching corners,\\nand rotate it diagonally so the slope is to the back left and the door points to the front right.\\n38. Locate a tan 1x3x3 arch and orient it horizontally, the base of the arch to the left. Place a sand green\\n1x3 plate horizontally onto the right two studs of the arch overhanging one stud to the right. This part\\nextends the eucalyptus tree in the back right corner. Place the base of the arch onto the leftmost stud of\\nthe horizontal sand green 1x3 plate that\u2019s currently on top of the eucalyptus tree base, the arch extending\\nto the right.\\n39. Build another part of the eucalyptus tree in three substeps.\\n39.1 Locate a tan 1x3x3 arch and orient it horizontally, the base of the arch to the right. Place a sand\\ngreen 1x3 plate horizontally onto the left two studs of the arch overhanging one stud to the left.\\n39.2 Locate a light bluish gray 2x2-1x2 centered bracket and put it onto the two rightmost studs of the\\nprevious piece, 2x2 anti-studs to the back.\\n39.3 Do not place the piece you just built onto the main piece yet, but place the base of the arch onto the\\nrightmost stud of a separate horizontal sand green 1x3 plate.\\nPlace the rightmost stud of the piece you just built to the left of the eucalyptus tree piece you placed in\\nstep 38, arch extending and plate overhanging to the left.\\n40.

Place the piece you just built in front of the base of the arch\\nyou placed in the previous step, arch extending to the front.\\n41. Locate a light bluish gray 1x2 plate and orient it vertically. Place a tan 1x1 plate onto its back stud.\\nPlace the piece you just built to connect the back stud of the arch from the previous step to the right stud\\nof the arch from step 39 which is located behind.\\n42. Place a light bluish gray 1x2 plate horizontally in the back row, connecting the 1x1 plate from the\\nprevious step to the arch to its right.\\n43. In this step you\u2019ll connect the base of the postcard (the piece you just built) to the background of the\\npostcard that you built earlier. To do so, orient the background so that the row with studs is at the front\\nand the plane is in the back left (so rotated by 180\u00b0 in relation to when you built the background). The\\nbase of the postcard should be oriented as when you built it, the windmill to the left and the eucalyptus\\ntree to the right. Flip the base of the postcard onto its back and place it like that onto the background of\\nthe postcard, flush at the left, bottom, and right. The two bracket pieces which were built into the\\neucalyptus tree should fit exactly into the two un-tiled 2x2 \u201choles\u201d in the background of the postcard.\\n44. Flip the combined piece right side up, so that the windmill is to the left and the eucalyptus tree is at\\nthe right. The small flying plane attached to the background of the postcard should be in the top left\\ncorner. Locate three sand green 1x1 round plant bricks with three leaves each. Place one of them on the\\nleftmost stud of the plate that protrudes from the eucalyptus tree to the left at about mid-height. Place\\nanother one of them on the rightmost stud of the plate that protrudes from the tree to the right slightly\\nfurther up.

Locate three sand green 1x1 round plant bricks with three leaves each as well as three tan bars with\\nthree prongs. Stick one of the bars, bar first into the top of each of the round plant bricks. The pieces you\\njust built will also be added to the eucalyptus tree. Place one of them to the left of the previous piece,\\nskipping one stud, at the very left of the top of the tree. Place another one on the second stud from the\\nright at the top of the tree, so in the middle of the sand green 1x3 plate. Place the third one on the\\nfrontmost stud of the plate that protrudes from the eucalyptus tree to the front at about mid-height.\\nSubbuild - Cockatoo (6 steps)\\n46. Locate a dark bluish gray 1x1 plate modified with a clip (vertical grip) and orient it so the clip is at the\\nleft. Place a white 1x1 plate modified with a tooth, tooth to the right, on top of it.\\n47. Locate a white 1x1 brick modified with studs on two opposite sides. Place it on top of the previous\\npiece, side studs to the front and back.\\n48. Locate two white 1x1 plate modifieds with a tooth. These will be the wings of the cockatoo. Place one\\nof them from the front to the brick modified from the previous step, tooth pointing down. Place the other\\none from the back to the brick modified from the previous step, tooth pointing right.\\n49. Locate a white 1x1-1x1 bracket and place it onto the brick modified from step 47, side stud to the left.\\n50. Place a dark bluish gray 1x1 slope from the left to the bracket from the previous step, slope to the\\nbottom. Place a white 1x1 plate on top of the bracket from the previous step.\\n51. Locate a bright light yellow 1x2 curved slope and orient it so that the slope is left. Place it onto the 1x1\\nplate from the previous step, overhanging to the right.\\n52. You have finished the cockatoo and will move it onto the eucalyptus tree, next. Place it onto the\\nfrontmost stud of the arch protruding to the front almost at the top of the tree. The cockatoo should be\\noriented the same as when you built it, with the clip pointing to the left.\\n53. Locate a yellow 2x2 tile and apply sticker number 2 to it. The sticker shows a jumping kangaroo and\\ntogether this will be the street sign warning of kangaroos. Flip the tile upright, smooth side to the front and\\nrotate it by 45\u00b0, so that the corners point to the left, top, right, and bottom. Place it from the front to the\\nstreet sign post at the very front right corner of the base.\\n54. Locate a white 2x6 tile and apply sticker number 1 to it. The sticker shows a wooden board with the\\nword \u201cAUSTRALIA\u201d in capital letters and dark green eucalyptus leaves at its sides. Place the tile\\nhorizontally from the front to the six studs in the bottom center of the base of the postcard, overhanging to\\nthe top.\\nCongrats, you have finished building the Australia Postcard.\\nThank you so much for building this set!']"}]}

Put the torso on top of the\\nlegs, then put the head on the torso, and put the hat on top. He wears blue pants, and a police uniform\\nwith epaulets, two breast pockets (one of which has his badge on it) and a tie. On his belt is a\\nmicrophone for his walkie-talkie. The back of the torso says \\'Police on it and features the radio itself\\ndangling at the back of his belt. He is smiling, with sideburns and a shortly trimmed beard. Now we\\'ll\\nbuild a flashlight. for the officer to use. Find a black 1x1 faucet piece, and a translucent yellow 1x1\\nround plate. Put the 1x1 round plate onto the wide end of the faucet piece. The flashlight is finished! You\\ncan put the narrow end of the faucet piece into the officer\\'s hand, so that the translucent yellow 1x1\\nround plate points to the front-- that way he\\'ll be able to see what\u2019s in front of him if it gets dark. \\nNow let\\'s build the police car.\\n1. Locate the large black base for the car. Orient it horizontally.\\n2. Place a yellow 1x4 plate horizontally onto the front row of the base-- the front row protrudes to the\\nfront and consists of 4 studs. Place a light gray 1x4 plate horizontally, directly behind the previous\\npiece. Then place a yellow 1x4 plate horizontally onto the back row of the base, onto the 4x1 protruding\\npart at the back, in the middle. Place a light gray 1x4 plate horizontally, directly in front of the previous\\npiece.\\n3. Place a yellow 1x2 steering wheel piece vertically directly in front of the previous piece\\'s left stud, so\\nthat the steering wheel is pointing right. Find a yellow 1x2x1 bar tile, it has a diagonal horizontal bar at\\nthe top. Place it vertically skipping two columns to the right of the previous piece, directly in front of the\\n1x4\\'s right stud, so that the bar is slightly to the right. This is the back of the car seat.\\n4. Place an orange 2x4 plate horizontally directly to the right of the previous piece. Its rightmost column\\nwill protrude to the right. Place a green 2x4 plate horizontally directly to the left of the steering wheel\\npiece. Its leftmost column will protrude to the left.\\n5. Place a dark tan 1x2 brick vertically onto the left column of the orange 2x4 plate (the first piece placed\\nin the previous step).\\n6. Place a red 2x3 brick horizontally onto the right three columns of the green 2x4 plate (the second\\npiece placed two steps ago)\\n7. Now we will make two separate parts, which we will attach to the car later. Locate a blue 2x4 U\\nshaped piece and orient it horizontally. This piece looks like the print letter U, it is rough on the\\nunderside, and its two ends stick up, while the middle 2x2 surface is lower. Place a white 1x4 bench\\npiece horizontally onto the back row of the 2x4, so that the back of the bench is in front. Place a blue\\n1x4 brick that says \"Police\" on it, horizontally in front of the previous piece, on the front row of the 2x4.\\nMake two of these parts. Place the first one onto the two 1x4 plates at the front of the car in the middle,\\nso that the \"Police\" sign is facing forward. Take the other assembly, rotate it 180 degrees so that the\\n\"Police\" is now facing backward. Place this assembly onto the two 1x4 horizontal plates at the back of\\nthe car in the middle, Police sign to the back.\\n8. Locate two blue 1x6 plates. Place the first one vertically onto the rightmost studs of the previous two\\nassemblies that you just placed and the dark tan 1x2 brick. This will connect them to the rest of the car.\\nPlace the other 1x6 vertically onto the leftmost studs of the previous two assemblies that were just\\nplaced and the right column of the red 2x3 brick.\\n9. Locate two blue mudguard pieces and orient them so that they are facing forward- attached arches to\\nthe front. These pieces are 2x2 bricks with horizontal arches attached to them. Place a blue 1x2 plate\\nhorizontally onto the front row of the mudguard piece. Do this for the other mudguard piece as well.\\nPlace the first one on the front right two studs of the base piece, right above the axle, to the right of the\\nfront two studs of the first 1x6 plate placed in the previous step. Place the second one symmetrically at\\nthe back right, to the right of the back two studs of the first 1x6 plate placed in the last step, leaving a\\n2x2 gap between the two previous pieces.\\n10. Locate two blue 1x2 curved slopes. Place them horizontally, onto the left studs of the 1x2 plates\\nplaced in the last step, curve to the left.\\n11. Place a blue 1x1 tile directly to the left of each of the two previous pieces. Place a blue 1x2 plate\\nwith one stud horizontally directly to the left of each of the two previous pieces.\\n12. Place a light gray 1x4 plate vertically centered onto the rightmost row of the orange 2x4 plate\\nprotruding out to the right of the assembly. It should overhang equally to the front and to the back. \\nPlace a dark gray 1x4 brick with 4 side studs directly onto the previous piece, vertically, so that the side\\nstuds are pointing to the right.\\n13. Now we will make the car\\'s rear bumper. We will attach it later, so put your car aside. Locate a blue\\n2x6 plate with four side studs on it and orient it horizontally so that the side studs are pointing\\nbackwards. Locate two red translucent 1x1 round plates and place them onto the 2x6, one in the back\\nright corner, one in the back left corner. Locate two dark gray 1x1 round plates and place one directly in\\nfront of each of the previous pieces. Locate two black 1x1 sloped tiles. Place the first one directly to the\\nright of the left previous piece, slope to the front. Locate a dark gray 1x2 grille tile and place it\\nhorizontally directly to the right of the previous piece. Place the other black 1x1 sloped tile directly to the\\nright of the previous piece, slope to the front, directly to the left of a 1x1 round plate. Place this assembly\\nhorizontally, centered, onto the side studs on the right side of your car, so that all of the 1x1 round plates\\nare pointing to the right, and the side studs are pointing up, directly to the right of all the other studs in\\nthe large assembly, flush with the studs of the dark gray 1x4 brick.\\n14. Locate two blue 2x3 plates, and place them vertically, one behind the other, centered onto the 1x4\\nbrick and the upward-facing side studs the bumper, with the fronts and backs resting on the ends of the\\nbumper which we just attached.\\n15.

Place a dark gray 1x1 circular plate on the front stud on the leftmost column. Place another on the back\\nstud in the same column\\n3. Place a light gray 2x4 plate, horizontally long and centered horizontally, on the ship so it overhangs\\none column to the right.\\n4. Keeping the angled side on the right, flip the ship over so the studs are down. Place a light gray 2x2\\ninverted curved slope tile, centered vertically with the cutout at the left, on the right two columns of antistud. \u201cAnti-stud\u201d is a term for the portion of a LEGO piece which accepts studs, like the bottom of a plate.\\n5. Place a dark gray 2x6 plate with two rounded corners, with the flat side at the front, to the left of the\\nprevious piece so it extends one row behind the previous piece. Place another symmetrically in front of\\nthe first.\\nOpen group 2.\\n6.1. Flip the ship back over to its original orientation. Now we\u2019ll assemble the two stud shooters. Start by\\nplacing a light gray stud shooter base, with the stud on the left, in front of you. Find the small slot on the\\ntop. Slide one of the small trigger pieces, with the semi-circular side at the bottom and the wide side at\\nthe left, into the slot and push down until it clicks into place. Make two of these. You can push a 1x1\\ncircular tile into the end opposite the stud, and push the little trigger down to launch it out, never to be\\nfound again!\\n6.2. Place one stud shooter, with the stud on the left, in front of the 2x4 plate on the right side of the ship.\\nPlace another, in the same orientation, behind the 2x4 plate.

Place another to the left of the first.\\n30.1. Place a clear 1x1 slope tile, with the thick side at the left, on the previous piece. This is the\\nwindshield of the microfighter! The Mandalorian will sit just to the left of the windshield.\\n30.2. Place a light gray 2x2 rounded curved slope tile, with the thick side at the left, on the right two\\ncolumns.\\nOpen group 7.\\n31.1. Now we\u2019ll start building the ship\u2019s engines! Set the main ship aside for now. Place a dark gray 2x2\\nribbed circular brick in front of you.\\n31.2. Place a light gray 2x2 truncated cone on the previous piece.\\n32. Rotate the engine so the cone is at the left. Push a light gray 5L axle into the hollow bottom of the\\nribbed circular brick, pushing it in from the right until it stops.\\n33. Place a light gray 8 tooth gear with a 1.5L axle on one side, with the axle at the front, onto the\\nprevious piece. Push it on from the right and slide it all the way to the left. We\u2019ll use the 1.5L axle to\\nmount the engine to the ship.\\n34.1. Push a dark gray 2x2 circular plate, with the studs at the right, onto the axle from the right. Push it\\nall the way to the left.\\n34.2. Place a light gray 2x2 tall cone, with the stud at the right, on the previous piece by pushing it over\\nthe axle.\\n35.1.

Dedicated on the\\n28th of October 1886, she was often the first thing people saw as they sailed into New York\u2019s harbor to\\nstart a new life in America.\\nIn 1876, French craftsmen began forging the individual elements of the Statue. While the outer design\\nand materials were given, the real challenge lay in the Statue\u2019s internal construction. Bartholdi turned to\\nthe French architect and structural engineer, Gustave Eiffel, and he proposed creating a 92 ft. (28 m)\\nskeletal central pylon upon which asymmetrical girders could be attached. Flat metal bars were then\\nbolted to the girders to hold the copper skin of the Statue in place. Eiffel would go on to use the same\\npylon construction method in his famous Eiffel Tower, which was completed in 1889.\\nThe entire Statue was completed in Paris between 1881 and 1884. It arrived amid great fanfare in New\\nYork aboard the French Navy ship Is\u00e9re on the 17th of June 1885. Once the pedestal was completed in\\n1886, the 151 ft. (46 m) tall statue was quickly assembled. The last section to be completed was the\\nStatue of Liberty\u2019s face, which remained covered until the official dedication on the 28th of October\\n1886. Rain and foggy weather did not stop over one million New Yorkers from turning out to cheer the\\nunveiling of the new Statue.\\nThe Statue of Liberty was intended to be seen as a universal symbol of enlightenment and freedom. The\\nrobed female figure itself represents Libertas, the Roman goddess of freedom, and although you cannot\\nsee her feet clearly, she stands among a broken shackle and chains, with her right foot raised, depicting\\nher moving away from oppression and slavery. The seven spikes on the crown represent the seven\\noceans and the seven continents of the world, reinforcing the universal concept of liberty. Over time, the\\nStatue would also emerge as a welcoming symbol of hope to different generations of immigrants to the\\nU.S. Between 1886 and 1924, almost 14 million immigrants entered the United States through New\\nYork. The Statue of Liberty was often the first thing they saw as they arrived by ship in their new\\nhomeland.\\nThe American National Park Service took over responsibility for the island in 1937 and set about\\ntransforming the area around the Statue into a park. Bedloe\u2019s Island was renamed Liberty Island in 1957\\nto commemorate the completion of this work. The Statue was designated a UNESCO World Heritage\\nSite in 1984 and continues to attract around 4 million visitors each year.\\nCelebrate a monumental blend of architecture and sculpture with this LEGO\u00ae Architecture 21042 The\\nStatue of Liberty set. America\u2019s iconic symbol of freedom stands more than 305 feet above Liberty\\nIsland in New York harbor, welcoming seafarers from around the globe. This impressive LEGO\\ninterpretation faithfully reproduces the monument's harmonious blend of sculpture and architecture with\\nits intricately detailed shield-lined pedestal, brick detailing and columned balconies. The beautifully\\ncrafted Lady Liberty statue features a flowing robe, broken shackles, 7-ray crown, iconic tablet, and an\\nupraised arm bearing a golden torch.

Then place a green 1x2 sloped\\ncurved tile onto the previous piece sloping left up. Then stack two green 1x1 plates and place them on\\ntop of the 1x1 brick.\\n157. Then place another gray 1x1 brick with four side studs onto the previous piece. Then place a green\\n1x1 sloped tile onto the previous piece sloping down back.\\n158. Then place a green 1x4 tile vertically onto the gray side studs on the front of the assembly, hanging\\ndown. Then place a green 1x2 tile horizontally under the previous piece and connect it to the side stud\\non the front of the assembly, overhanging to the right.\\n159. Locate two green 1x4 tiles and place them vertically, one right above the other, onto the side studs\\non the left of the assembly, the top one being secured at the bottom with the top 1x1 brick and\\nprotruding to the top by 3 studs.\\n160. Stack two green radar dishes on top of each other.\\n161. Locate two green 1x1 bricks, one with one side stud and one with two side studs on opposite sides.\\nPlace the one with two side studs on opposite sides on the radar dishes with the side studs pointing left\\nand right. Place the other 1x1 onto the first one with the side stud pointing forward.\\n162. Place a green 1x1 plate onto the side stud of the previous piece. Place a green 1x1 cone on top of\\nthe 1x1, behind the previous piece you just placed.\\n163. Place a green 1x2 sloped curved tile vertically onto the 1x1 plate from the previous step sloping\\ndown.\\n164. Rotate the assembly 180 degrees so that the previous piece is now at the back and flip it upsidedown so that the radar dishes are at the top. Locate the orange flame piece, it\\'s a minifigure hairpiece.\\nFlip it upside down. Place an orange 1x1 round plate into the flame piece. Place a white pole piece into\\nthe hole of the 1x1 piece. Then slide the pole through a green 1x1 cone piece, wide end to the top.\\nRotate the assembly 180 degrees so that the pole is now pointing down and insert it into the previous\\nassembly to finish the torch.\\n165. Combine this assembly to the other assembly by connecting the side stud on the left side to the top\\nend of the 1x4 tiles, so that the torch is tilted to the right, with the 1x1 sloped tile touching the 1x2 sloped\\ncurved tile.\\n166. Place a green 1x4 tile vertically onto the two side studs connecting them.\\n167. Rotate the assembly so that the torch is pointing forward and up.

Bend the hinged brick slightly back, about half of its range of motion.\\n168. Place this assembly onto the statue so that the hinged brick connects to the small two stud gap in\\nthe top left section of the statue, reaching forward. The arm should rest against a 1x2 sloped tile.\\n169. Now we\\'ll make the statue\\'s crown. Locate the green 2x2 octagonal plate. Place a round green 2x2\\nplate onto it. Take seven green clip pieces with a hole and insert a green rubber horn piece into each of\\nthem. Clip these around the octagonal piece. Because there are only 7, there should be a gap along one\\nof the edges of the octagon. Place a gray 1x1 round plate in the middle of the 2x2 round plate. Place a\\ngreen radar dish on this plate. Connect this to the statue by clipping the empty edge of the octagon onto\\nthe clip piece on the head of the statue. Hinge the crown down over the head. Place a green 2x2 plate\\nonto the two side studs on the face of the statue, directly under the crown. Place a green 2x2\\npentagonal tile onto the previous piece with the sharp corner pointing down.\\n170. Locate a green 1x2 brick and orient it horizontally. Place a green 1x3 plate horizontally over the\\n1x2 with its right stud hanging over to the right. Then place a green 1x1 brick under this overhanging\\nstud. Locate three green 1x1 bricks with one side stud each. Place them onto the 1x3 plate so that the\\nside studs are pointing left, right, and forward. Place a green 2x1 brick horizontally over the left two\\n1x1s. Place a green 1x1 brick directly to the right of the previous piece. Place a green 1x3 plate\\nhorizontally over the previous two pieces. Place a green 1x3 tile horizontally over the previous piece.\\nPlace a green 1x3 plate horizontally so that its middle stud goes over the side stud on the front middle of\\nthe assembly.

For example, step 5 is now steps 5.1 and 5.2.\\nSide build - Tree branch with flowers.\\nOpen bag 1.\\nOpen group 1.\\n1.1. We will start with the base of the branch. Place a green 4x6 half circular plate in front of you, with the\\nflat side at the back.\\n1.2. Place a dark brown 2x2 circular brick on the back row of the previous piece, centered horizontally,\\nextending one stud to the back.\\n2. Place a green 4x6 half circular plate behind the first half circular plate, with the flat side at the front so\\nthe two half-circles make an entire circle.\\n3. Place a dark green 2x2 slope in front of the 2x2 circular brick, centered horizontally, sloping down to\\nthe front. Place another dark green 2x2 slope symmetrically behind the 2x2 circular brick. Place a dark\\ngreen 2x2 slope to the left of the 2x2 circular brick, sloping down to the left. Place another dark green 2x2\\nslope symmetrically to the right of the 2x2 circular brick.\\n4. Place a light brown 4x4 circular plate on the previous pieces, centered vertically and horizontally.\\n5.1. Place a dark brown 2x2 circular plate with four upward arms on the previous piece, centered\\nvertically and horizontally.\\n5.2. Place a dark brown 2x2 circular brick on the previous piece, centered vertically and horizontally.\\n6. Now we\u2019ll make the branch a bit taller by adding a trunk. Place a dark brown 2x2 circular brick in front\\nof you and put a light brown 2x2 circular tile with a hole onto it. Rotate this assembly 90 degrees so the\\ncircular tile is sideways on the left.\\n7. Place a dark brown straight axle connector onto one end of a light gray 9L axle. Push the axle through\\nthe assembly from step 6 from the left. Push it in until the axle connector touches the circular tile from the\\nprevious step.\\n8.1. Slide the center axle hole of a dark brown 2x2 circular brick onto the right end of the axle until it\\nattaches to the 2x2 circular brick from step 6.\\n8.2. Slide the center axle hole of a dark brown 2x2 circular plate with four upward arms onto the right end\\nof the axle, with the arms at the left. Push it to the left until it connects to the previous piece.\\n9.1. Slide another dark brown 2x2 circular brick onto the axle like we did in step 8.1.\\n9.2.

Rotate the trunk 90 degrees so the trunk is pointing up and down and the axle connector is at the top.\\nPush the axle through the center of the 2x2 circular brick from step 5, pushing down until it connects to\\nthe circular brick from step 5.\\n11.1. Orient a green 6x5 plant leaves so that the end with only a single stud is at the left, and attach this\\nstud onto the rightmost upward arm on the bottom 2x2 circular plate with four upwards arms. The rest of\\nthe plant leaves should extend to the right. A parallel column of two studs should be at the far right.\\n11.2. Place a dark brown square robot arm onto the far left upward arm on the bottom 2x2 circular plate\\nwith four arms. Use the square part of the robot arm to attach it, not the clip. The clip should be up and to\\nthe left. Place another dark brown square robot onto the front upward arm on the top 2x2 circular plate\\nwith four arms. Use the square part of the arm again, and the clip should be up and to the front.\\nOpen group 2.\\n12. Now we\u2019ll start building a blue and yellow flower, so set the base of the branch aside for now. Place a\\nwhite 2x2 circular plate with an octagonal bar farm around it in front of you.\\n13. Place an orange 1x1 circular plate onto each stud of the previous piece so it makes a square of studs.\\n14.1. Now we\u2019ll make petals! Place a white 1x1 plate with a vertical clip on one side in front of you, with\\nthe clip on the right.\\n14.2, Place a yellow 1x2 curved slope tile, horizontally long, on the previous piece, sloping down to the\\nright, and extending one stud to the left. The cut out should be on the left.\\n14.3. Attach a petal to each diagonal bar using the clip. The slope tile should be on top. If you draw a line\\nthrough two opposite petals, it should go through two diagonal corners of the 2x2 square of studs\\ndescribed in step 12. Hinge all the petals down so they lay flat.\\n15.1. Now we\u2019ll make some larger petals. Place a light blue 1x2 half cylinder slope onto a white 1x2 plate\\nwith a vertical clip on one long side, with the clip on your left and the slope vertically long, sloping up to\\nthe left. Repeat this three more times to create a total of four larger petals.\\n15.2. Keeping the clip at the left, flip a petal over so the slope is at the bottom. Attach it to the far right\\nvertical bar on the flower. Hinge it 90 degrees counterclockwise so the plate with a clip is at the left and\\nthe slope is at the right. Repeat this for each larger petal, keeping the slope on the outside of the flower\\nand the plate with a clip on the inside. Flip the flower over so its face is down.\\n16.1.

Set the base of the branch in front of you with the leaf on the right. Attach the bar from step 16.1 to\\nthe left robot arm on the branch.The flower should hang down off the branch. Rotate the flower so its face\\nis angled up at about 45 degrees.\\nOpen group 3.\\n18. We\u2019re going to build another flower now. It\u2019s built the same way as the first, but using two shades of\\npink. Place a white 2x2 circular plate with an octagonal bar farm around it in front of you.\\n19. Place a yellow 1x1 circular plate with a flower pattern onto each stud of the previous piece so it\\nmakes a square of studs.\\n20.1. Now we\u2019ll make petals! Place a light purple 1x2 curved slope tile onto a white 1x1 plate with a\\nvertical clip, with the clip on your right, and the slope horizontally long, sloping up to the left. Repeat this\\nthree more times to create a total of four small petals.\\n20.2. Attach a petal to each diagonal bar using the clip. The slope tile should be on top. If you draw a line\\nthrough two opposite petals, it should go through two diagonal corners of the 2x2 square of studs\\ndescribed in step 12. Hinge all the petals down so they lay flat.\\n21.1. Now we\u2019ll make some larger petals. Place a pink 1x2 half cylinder slope onto a white 1x2 plate with\\na vertical clip on one long side, with the clip on your left and the slope vertically long, sloping up to the\\nleft.

Attach it to the far right\\nvertical bar on the flower. Hinge it 90 degrees counterclockwise so the plate with a clip is at the left and\\nthe slope is at the right. Repeat this for each larger petal, keeping the slope on the outside of the flower\\nand the plate with a clip on the inside. Flip the flower over so its face is down.\\n22.1. Place a tan 1x2 plate with a bar on one long side in front of you, horizontally long, with the bar at the\\nfront.\\n22.2. Place a dark green 2x2 inverted curved slope tile on the previous piece, so it slopes up in the back.\\n22.3. Place a black 2x2 circular plate on the pieces from the previous step. Flip the assembly over and\\nattach it to the flower, centered vertically and horizontally. Rotate the flower so its studs are sideways on\\nthe left, and the bar from step 16.1 is above the curved tile slope from step 16.2.\\n23. Set the base of the branch in front of you with the leaf on the right. Attach the bar from step 16.1 to\\nthe front robot arm on the branch.The flower should hang down off the branch. Rotate the flower so its\\nface is angled up at about 45 degrees.\\nOpen group 4.\\n24.1. Place a light green 4x3 plant leaves in front of you, horizontally long. The leaves at the left end\\nshould come to a point like a sideways letter V.\\n24.2. Place two purple 1x1 plates with three leaves on the far right stud, one on top of the other. Place\\nthese two pieces so the leaves face away from each other, so they form a flower with six petals.\\n24.3. Place an orange 1x1 circular plate on the top piece from the previous step. Repeat steps 24.1-24.3\\nto make another leaf with a flower.\\n24.4. Attach one leaf with a small flower to the top right upwards bar on the branch, using the stud on the\\nopposite end from the flower, above the 6x5 leaf piece. Attach the other leaf with a small flower to the top\\nback upwards arm.\\nMain build - Pink Parrot:\\nOpen group 5.\\n25.1. Now we\u2019ll start building the parrot! The parrot stands on the branch, and we\u2019ll start with its feet.\\nPush the axle of a blue axle/pin combo into the straight axle connector pointing up at the top of the\\nbranch.\\n25.2. Place a black pin connector with two 2L thin lift-arms on one side down over the previous piece,\\nwith the lift-arms pointing up. This piece will spin freely.\\n26.1. Place a dark gray 4L axle with a circular stop at one end in front of you with the stop down and the\\naxle pointing up.\\n26.2. Slide a black 3L axle with a hole in the middle over the previous piece. The axle will spin freely. This\\nis the stick that the parrot is perched on.\\n27. Place a dark gray thick bushing with a perpendicular bar on each side onto the axle, with the bar\\nextending right and left. The parrot\u2019s talons will attach to these bars.\\n28. Slide two dark pink thin bushings over the upwards axle from step 25.1. Push them down until they\\ntouch the previous piece. This is one of the parrot\u2019s feet! Repeat steps 26.1-28 to make another.\\n29. Find the pin connector with two 2L lift-arms from step 25.2. Spin it so the lift-arms are at the front.\\nKeeping the axle up, push the stick (3L axle with hole from step 26.2.) into the top axle hole on the left liftarm from the left. Repeat this symmetrically on the right. Now the parrots legs should stick upwards!\\n30. We\u2019re going to decorate the perch a little bit. Place a dark brown 3-way axle connector with a center\\npin hole in front of you, so one leg points to your left, and the other two legs angle to the right. Place a 1L\\npin in the center hole with the stud up.\\n31. Place a light green bar with two leaves on top into the stud on the pin.\\n32. Place a 2L axle into each of the two right legs of the axle connector.\\n33. Place a brown 1x1 cone onto each of the pieces from the previous step.\\n34. Attach a light green 4x3 plant leaves onto each cone so the leaves hang downwards. Attach using the\\nstud where the leaves come to a point.\\n35. Stick a light green bar with two leaves on top through the stud attached to the cone from the previous\\npieces.\\n36. Attach this branch assembly to the right side of the perch using the empty leg of the 3-way axle\\nconnector, with one leg up and the other down. Once it is attached, adjust the angle of the leaves to your\\nliking.\\nOpen group 6.\\n37.1. Now the parrot will get some talons! Push a black bar with a claw into the bar hole of a dark gray\\nbar connector with a clip at one end. Repeat this step 3 more times to make 3 more talons.\\n37.2. Attach the clip of one talon to the left bar on the left bushing with a bar from step 27. Rotate it so it\\nhangs down, with the claw pointing towards the back.

Push the axle through the hole in the reel, centering it on the reel.\\n169.4. Place a gear on both ends of the axle.\\n169.5. Feed the string through the hole in the reel and tie a knot. Feed the other end through the hole in\\nthe ball of the hook plate, and tie it off as well. Now, when you turn the gears, the winch will reel in the\\nhook! With the crane arm pointing towards the right, attach the winch onto the 2x2 of studs at the left end\\nof the crane, with the gears at the front and back of the winch. Pull the hook all the way out, guide it\\nthrough the upright clip and the wire guide on the crane arm, then let the hook dangle downwards. You\\ncan now turn the gears to raise and lower the hook!\\nIf stringing isn\u2019t working by touch, you can try winding the end of the string around a toothpick or sewing\\nneedle to help guide it through or use a split-eye sewing needle. When doing this on the reel, the axle will\\nimpede your ability to pull it through. So you may want to remove the axle, feed the string through, tie a\\nvery loose knot (to leave space for the axle to feed back through), then replace the axle and gears.\\n170. We\u2019re going to work on the stern of the ship now! Find two white 2x2 bricks. Stack them on top of\\neach other, and place them centered vertically, on the fifth and sixth columns from the right end of the\\nship.\\n171.

It won\u2019t look like much for a while, but be\\npatient!\\n1. Find a dark gray 3x3 L-shaped thin lift-arm, and two light gray 3L axles. Place the lift-arm flat, with the\\ncorner at the front right, one leg vertically long at the right and one horizontally long at the front. Place\\naxles in the axle-holes at the corner and at the back, skipping over the pin-hole. Push the axles in only\\nuntil they are flush with the bottom side.\\n2. Place another dark gray 3x3 L-shaped thin lift-arm on the one from the previous step, oriented the\\nsame way. Do this by pushing it down over the two axles from the previous step until the lift-arms touch.\\n3. Find a blue 3L pin and a light gray 3x2 T-shaped thick lift-arm, with an axle-hole parallel to its long axis.\\nPlace the pin with the stop downwards, into the pin-hole directly to the left of the corner of the lift-arms\\nfrom step 1-2. Place the axle-hole of the lift-arm over the axle on the back, with the long portion of the liftarm on the right. Rotate the assembly 90 degrees so that the T-shaped lift-arm is on top and the L\\nshaped lift-arm is at the back on the left.\\n4. Find a dark gray 9L thick lift-arm and place it horizontally long, with the far left pin-hole over the blue\\npin from the previous step. The second hole from the left should slide over the axle in the corner from\\nstep 1. Push the lift-arm all the way down until it is against the L-shaped lift-arm from step 2. This 9L liftarm is at the bottom of the truck\u2019s chassis, so the side that is currently down is the very bottom of the\\ndump truck! It should be flat on the building surface. It forms the centerline of the truck, so most of the\\nbuild will be symmetric about this lift-arm.\\nOpen group 2\\nSet the truck aside for now. We\u2019re going to start building the headlight assembly.\\n5. Find two light gray 1L pins, and a dark gray 2x2 T-shaped thick lift-arm, with an axle-hole parallel to its\\nlong axis. Place the T-shaped lift-arm with the two pin-holes at the back and the axle-hole at the front.\\nPlace two 1L pins into the pin-holes with the studs up.\\n6. Find two transparent clear 1x1 round tiles. Place these on top of the studs from the previous pieces.\\nThese will eventually be half the headlights of the truck!\\n7. Find a black 6L axle and a light gray thin bush. Place the axle into the axle-hole in the lift-arm from the\\nprevious piece, extending to the right and flush with the left side of the axle-hole. Slide the bush on the\\naxle all the way to the lift-arm. Place the original chassis assembly in front of you in its original orientation,\\nhorizontally long with the lift-arms from step 1-2 pointing upwards and at the back of the assembly.\\n8. Slide the assembly from steps 5-7 towards you from the back, through the far left axle-hole, with the\\nheadlight assembly on top and at the back. The clear tiles should be on the left.\\n9. Slide a dark gray pin with a perpendicular axle-hole over the 6L axle from the headlight assembly.\\n10. Slide two dark gray 3x3 L-shaped thin lift-arm over the axles and pins from previous steps. Slide them\\nover in the same orientation as the lift-arms from steps 1 and 2 so that they are mirrored about the 9L liftarm which is the center of the truck. The right six holes of the 9L lift-arm should be open at this point.\\n11. Slide a light gray bush over the axle in front of the previous pieces.\\n12. Find two transparent clear 1x1 round tiles, a dark gray 2x2 T-shaped thick lift-arm, with an axle-hole\\nparallel to its long axis, and two light gray 1L pins. Place the lift-arm on the axle of the headlight\\nassembly, with the pin-holes on top. Place the two 1L pins into the holes on the previous piece, with the\\nstuds at the left. Place the round tiles onto the studs on the previous piece. There should now be four\\nheadlights on the left of the truck!\\nOpen group 3\\nSet the chassis aside. Now we\u2019ll start building the steering mechanism for the front wheels!\\n13. Find a light gray 3L axle and a light gray axle connector with a perpendicular pin-hole. The axle-hole\\nin the connector should end at the pin, so that if the center lines were extended it would make the shape\\na capital T. Place the connector with the axle-hole horizontal and the pin-hole on the left, going up and\\ndown. Insert the axle into the axle-hole.\\n14. Find a light gray 2L pin and a dark gray perpendicular axle and pin connector. The center lines are\\noffset by a brick length so that if the center lines were extended it would make the shape of an X when\\nviewed from above. Slide the axle-hole of the connector over the previous piece, with the pin-hole at the\\nback pointing up and down. Slide it all the way until it touches the axle and pin connector from the\\nprevious step. Put the pin in the pin-hole of the previous piece, pointing up.\\n15. Place a light gray axle connector with a perpendicular pin-hole symmetrically to the one from step 13.\\n16. Find two light gray 3L lift-arms with pins perpendicular to its short axis. Viewed from the side, this\\npiece has a pin extending up at the left and right ends, and a perpendicular pin-hole under each pin.A pinhole is in the middle, parallel to the pins. Place one into the bottom of the previous piece, extending\\ntowards the front, with the pins facing upwards. Place the other symmetrically on the left side.\\n17. Find four light gray 2L pins. Place one in the front pinhole of each of the previous pieces, pointing\\noutwards. The front wheels will mount on these pins later on! Place the other two with the middle pin-hole\\nof both of the lift-arms from the previous step, with the pin extending upwards.\\n18. Find two dark gray 5L thick lift-arms. Place one horizontally long on the previous pieces. It should only\\nfit using the far left and right pin-holes on the lift-arm. Place the other lift-arm directly in front. This\\ncompletes the steering mechanism! If you hold one of the previous pieces, the other should move freely\\nin a roughly half-circular motion. Now we\u2019ll attach it to the chassis!\\n19. Place the chassis horizontally long in front of you with the headlights at the left, bottom of the truck\\ndown (as defined in step 4). Take the steering mechanism and place it vertically long on the right end of\\nthe chassis, with the upwards peg at the right, and slide the mechanism all the way to the left, centered\\nvertically. It should slide smoothly. The lift-arm with the pegs for the front wheels should be even with the\\nbottom of the chassis. The left 1x5 thick lift-arm from the steering mechanism should be lined up\\nunderneath a 1x3 thick lift-arm on top of the chassis.\\n20. Place two blue 3L pins, with the stop upwards, and place them through the 1x3 thick lift-arm at the top\\nof the truck. Push each one all the way down to the stop, through the left 1x5 thick lift-arm of the steering\\nassembly.\\n21. Find two blue 3L pins. Slide the first into the far right pin-hole of the build, from front to back with the\\nstop at the front. It should extend one brick length to the front and back of the build. Skip a hole and place\\nthe other pin in the same way.\\n22. Find a dark gray 5.5L axle with a stop 1L from one end. Slide it into the hole between the two previous\\npieces from back to front with the stop at the back. It should sit loosely in the hole.\\nNow we are going to start building the back of the chassis!\\nOpen group 4\\n23. Find a dark gray 9L lift-arm and a tan 3L pin. Place the lift-arm in front of you horizontally long,\\nsmooth side up. Place the short side of the pin in the far right hole, with the pin extending 2L to the front.\\n24. Find a yellow 5L axle and a light gray 3L thin lift-arm with a pin at one end and a thick axle-hole at the\\nother. Place the axle into the thick axle-hole of the lift-arm, centering it. It should extend 2L to either side\\nof the lift-arm. Now attach this assembly to the 9L lift-arm from the previous step, with the axle next to the\\npin from the previous step, the pin two steps to the left and the thin side of the lift-arm at the back against\\nthe 9L lift-arm. The pin should click into place and the axle should extend 1L past the back edge of the liftarm from the previous step.\\n25. Place two black 2L pins into the lift-arm from step 23, on the back side, next to each other to the left of\\nthe pin from the previous piece.\\n26.

Under his jacket\\nhe wears a white collared shirt and a red tie. He has unruly black hair, and round, thin-rimmed glasses.\\nSub-build 1: Road Sign\\nOpen group 1.\\n1.1. We\u2019ll start building the sign to Hogwarts! Place a green 4x4 circular plate in front of you.\\n1.2. Place a dark gray 2x2 circular tile with a single stud on top, on the previous piece, centered vertically\\nand horizontally.\\n2. Place a green 1x1 plate with three leaves on the leftmost stud of the second row from the back on the\\n4x4 circular plate, with the leaves pointing left. Place another symmetrically on the right side of the 4x4\\ncircular plate.\\n3. Place a white candle upright, with the bar down, into the stud of the 2x2 circular tile with a single stud\\non top. A candle is a 2L cylinder with a short bar sticking out on one end, and a hole for a bar on the other\\nend. Place another candle on top of the previous candle by sticking its bar into the bar hole of the\\nprevious candle. Do this two more times until the sign is four candles tall.\\n4. Place a black 1x1 circular brick with four upward bars, and one downward bar on the previous piece.\\nAttach it with the downward bar inserted into the hole on top of the top candle. This will be the frame of\\nthe lantern on the sign. Rotate this piece so that there is one bar in each cardinal direction: front, back,\\nleft, right. These bars will be the attachment points for the signs!\\n5.1. Now let\u2019s put the light in the lantern! Place a transparent yellow 1x1 circular brick onto the stud in the\\ncenter of the previous piece.\\n5.2. Place a black 1x1 circular tile on the previous piece.\\n6.1. Now we\u2019ll make a sign board for Hogsmeade. Place a white 1x2 plate with a vertical clip on the short\\nside, horizontally long, in front of you with the clip on the left.\\n6.2. Place a white 1x3 tile with a \u201cHOGSMEADE\u201d sticker, horizontally long, on the previous piece,\\noverhanging one stud to the right.\\n6.3. Place a white 1x1 plate with a horizontal tooth on one side, horizontally long, under the right stud of\\nthe previous piece, with the tooth at the right.\\n6.4. Attach the clip to the right bar on the lantern so the sign extends horizontally to the right, with the\\ntooth pointing right like an arrow. The \u201cHOGSMEADE\u201d sticker should be at the front.\\nOpen group 2.\\n7.1. Now it\u2019s time to make the sign for Hogwarts, which is in the opposite direction. Place a white 1x2\\nplate with a vertical clip on the short side, horizontally long, in front of you with the clip on the right.\\n7.2.

Let\u2019s start putting it together. Find a dark gray 1x14 brick with pin-holes on the side, and place it\\nhorizontally long in front of you.\\n1.2. Place a black 2L pin into the leftmost and rightmost holes on the side of the previous piece, pushing\\nthem in from the front.\\n2. Place another 1x14 brick with pin-holes on the side, horizontally long, onto the pins from the previous\\nstep so that you now have a 2x14 brick. This is the frame of the locomotive!\\n3.1. Place a light gray 1x10 brick with pin-holes on the side, and place it horizontally long in front of you.\\n3.2. Place a tan axle/pin combo into the leftmost, center, and rightmost pin-holes from the front, so the\\naxle extends to the front. There should be three holes between each axle.\\n3.3. Place a black pin into the second pin-hole from the left, pushing it in from the back. Place another\\ninto the second pin-hole from the right, again pushing it in from the back.\\n3.4. Use the black pins to attach the 1x10 brick with pin-holes to the front of the frame, lining up the left\\nends. The frame should extend four studs past the end of the 1x10 brick.\\n3.5. Repeat steps 3.1-3.3, and attach it symmetrically to the back side of the frame. There should now be\\nthree axles extending on the front and back sides of the frame. These will hold the main driving wheels for\\nthe locomotive! Keeping the 1x10 bricks and the left, and the frame horizontally long, flip the frame over\\nso the studs are down.\\n4.1. Place a dark gray 2x4 plate, vertically long, on the left two columns of anti-stud. \u201cAnti-stud\u201d is a term\\nfor the portion of a LEGO piece which accepts studs, like the bottom of a plate. Place another, vertically\\nlong, on the right two columns of anti-stud on the 1x10 bricks, so there are four exposed columns of antistud to the right.\\n4.2. Place a light gray 2x2 circular plate on the right two columns of anti-stud. Flip the frame back over\\ninto its original configuration, horizontally long, with the previous piece at the right on the bottom.\\n5.1. Place a dark gray 2x3 plate with one rounded end with a hole in it, horizontally long, on the right two\\ncolumns, so the rounded end overhangs to the right. This will be used later to attach the tender to the\\nengine! The tender is the small car that carries the locomotive\u2019s fuel (coal or oil) and water!\\n5.2. Place an orange 2x2 brick on the previous piece, even with the left end.\\n6.1. Place a black 1x12 brick, horizontally long, in front of, and aligned with the right end of the 2x2 brick\\nfrom the previous step.

Attach the bar to the clip at the left end of the bogie. Then hinge the bumper clockwise 90 degrees\\nuntil it attaches to the four side studs at the left side of the train. Keeping the bumper at the left, flip the\\ntrain over so the studs point down.\\n19. Now we\u2019ll start attaching the wheels to the train. We\u2019ll start with the driving wheels. These are the\\nlarge wheels which actually move the train forward. Place a large train wheel with a flange on the front left\\naxle, with the flange against the frame. The flange is the raised portion on the edge of the wheel. This sits\\ninside of the rails and prevents the train from derailing! Place another large wheel with a flange on the\\nright axle. Place two more symmetrically on the back side of the frame.\\n20. Place a large wheel without a flange on the middle axle on the front of the frame, and another on the\\nmiddle axle of the back of the frame. The flat side of the wheels should be on the outward side of the\\nlocomotive.\\n21.1. Now we\u2019ll put the wheels on the bogie!

The instructions\\nshow a flower plate on the fourth and sixth tie from the right, and a quarter circle tiles on the second and\\neighth ties from the right.\\nCongratulations! Now Hogwarts Express and Hogsmeade Station are complete! The students can sit in\\nthe train cars! Unfortunately, their legs don\u2019t bend, so they stand in the seats. The trolley witch can stand\\nnext to her cart. You can drive the train on the floor and drive it up the ramp to have it pull into the station!\\nIf you have LEGO trains, this train will fit on the same tracks!\\nThank you so much for building this set!']"}]}

This set is difficult to build. Be very careful when handling the various assemblies when\\nconnecting them and lots of patience is needed when building this set! Do not press too hard on\\nassemblies if you don't think they're connecting properly, otherwise everything will implode and pieces will\\nfly everywhere.\\nBuilding Instructions (Bags 1):\\nGroup 1 \u2014 Back of Torso:\\n1. Locate 1 red 1x4 plate and 1 red 1x6 brick. With your plate horizontally placed, horizontally place your\\nbrick on top of it so that it overhangs 1 stud on the left and right.\\n2. Locate 2 red 1x6 plates. Vertically place the back stud of each plate underneath the overhang of the\\n1x6 brick.\\n3. Locate 2 red 1x10 bricks. Vertically place on top of the left and right so that the back side is touching\\nthe 1x6 brick. There should be a 1x5 overhang in the front on both pieces.\\n4. Locate 2 red 1x6 plates. Vertically place each plate underneath the overhang of each PPP so that the\\nfront stud of each plate is visible.\\n5. Locate 1 red 1x6 brick and 1 red 1x4 plate. With your plate horizontally placed, horizontally place your\\nbrick on top of it so that it overhangs 1 stud on the left and right. Then horizontally place this build in the\\nfront so that the overhang sits on the 2 visible studs from plates from step 4. You should now end up with\\na rectangular frame. Keep the build vertical.\\n6. Locate 4 red 2x2 plates and 2 red 1x2 slope tiles. Place each of the 2x2 plates in the corners so that\\nthey overhang 1 stud inside the rectangle. Then symmetrically and horizontally place your slope tiles in\\nthe front and back gaps created by the 2 red 2x2 plates. Make sure that the slopes are going down\\ntoward the center of the rectangle.\\n7. Locate 2 red 1x4 plates and 2 red 2x6 plates. Horizontally place 1 red 2x6 plate behind the front 2x2\\nplates so that the left and right ends sit on top of the brick. Then do the same for the other 2x6 plate but in\\nfront of the back 2x2 plates. Now vertically place your 1x4 plates in between the 2x6 plates on the left and\\nright sides\\n8. Locate 2 red 2x6 bricks and 4 red 1x2 grill slope tiles that run vertically. Vertically place your 2 grill\\nslopes in the back to the left and right of the 1x2 slope tile so that the slopes run down from back to front.\\nThen vertically place your remaining 2 grill slopes in the front to the left and right of the 1x2 slope tile so\\nthat the slopes run down from front to back. Then orient your build so it is horizontal. Then horizontally\\nplace your 2x6 bricks in the front and back so that there is no overhang and that there is a free column of\\nstuds on the left and right between these bricks and the slopes that you just placed.\\n9. Locate 4 tall red 1x2 slopes. Vertically place 2 to the left and right of the back 2x6 brick so that the\\nslope goes down from back to front. Then in the back left and right corners, horizontally place your\\nremaining 2 slopes so that they go down outwards. Doing this should create 2 1x2 studded areas on top\\nof the slopes.\\n10. Locate 2 more tall red 1x2 slopes. Horizontally place these on top of the 2 1x2 studded areas on top\\nof the previously placed slopes. Make sure they go down outwards. Then locate 1 red 1x6 tall panel.\\nHorizontally place this in the back gap created by the slopes so that the outer wall is facing back.\\nGroup 2 \u2014 Inner Mechanism:\\n11. Put your main build aside for now. Then locate 1 red 1x4 brick with 3 holes, and 1 teal 1x2 plate.\\nPlace down your red brick horizontally and then horizontally place your teal plate on top of this brick in the\\nmiddle.\\n12. Locate 1 light grey 1x2 brick with a cross-hole and 1 more teal 1x2 plate. Horizontally place the 1x2\\nbrick on top of the teal plate that is on the 1x4 brick. Then horizontally place your teal 1x2 plate on top of\\nthis brick.\\n13. Locate 1 white 1x4 plate with inverted slopes, 1 tan 1x2 brick with 2 holes, and 2 purple 1x1 circular\\nplates. Horizontally place your white 1x4 plate with inverted slopes on top of the teal 1x2 plate placed in \\nthe previous step. Make sure that only the inverted slopes are overhanging on the left and right. Then in\\nthe gap of the white 1x4 plate with inverted slopes, horizontally place your tan 1x2 brick. Now place your\\n1x1 circular plates to the left and right of this brick so that they sit on top of the inverted slopes. Put this\\nsub-build aside for now.\\nNote for steps 14-23, you will be doing these steps twice to make two pieces that hold the arms so do\\nthem twice as you go through these steps.\\n14.

Rotate the assembly back to how it was before, with the ball socket pointing back to the left. Locate\\nthe two bright light-yellow flag pieces with clips. Clip the first one onto the tan bar at the front bottom left\\nof the assembly, so that it points down and to the left and front, cutoff angle to the left. Clip the second\\none onto the tan bar at the back bottom left of the assembly, so that it points down and to the left and\\nback cut-off corner to the left. Locate two dark gray 1x1 rounded plates with a bar clip attached. Then\\nlocate two dark gray 1x1 sloped curved tiles with cut-off corner. Orient the first 1x1 plate so that the bar\\npoints to the back. Place the tile onto the stud so that it slopes forward. Connect this to the main\\nstructure by clipping the bar to the orange clip in the front top middle clip on the main structure. The\\npointy part of the slope to the front right. Orient the second 1x1 plate so that the bar points forward.\\nPlace the tile onto the stud so that it slopes to the back, point to the back right. Connect this to the main\\nstructure by clipping the bar to the orange clip in the back top middle clip on the main structure. The\\nsloped piece should slope back, point to the back right.\\nNow connect this new front section to the 2 completed body sections.\\n56. Connect this to the main structure by snapping the pin in the end of the last assembly into the hole in\\nthe right of the previous assembly. When connected you will hear a \"click\".\\nNow let\\'s build the head!\\n57. Locate the big blue and tan skimwing head piece and snap the tan and orange mouthpiece into\\nposition. Orient it so that the face points left.\\n58. Snap a black ball joint technic pin piece into the hole in the right side of the head.\\n59. Locate the two stringy rubbery dark gray pieces and insert their ends into the two small holes on the\\nright side of the head. The other ends should end up pointing up naturally.\\nJoin the head to the body!\\n60. Connect the head to the rest of the animal by snapping the round ball joint in the right side of the\\nhead into the ball joint socket on the left of the rest of the animal.\\nThis next part is a little tricky, we will build the wing structure starting with two large wings for the front of\\nthe Skimwing and then two smaller ones towards the tail.\\n61. You will build 2 of the wings described in steps 61 to 66. Locate a yellow three long technic axle and\\ninsert it into a black technic piece with a snap hinge on its other end. Orient this assembly so that the\\naxle end points left. The snap hinge should be vertical.\\n62. Slide two black technic pieces onto the axle each of which are 1/2 stud thick and have two axle\\nholes in them. They should point back.\\n63. Insert a two long red axle into the other axle holes of the previous two pieces. Its end should point\\nleft. Slide a black technic elbow piece onto this end of the previous piece. Its end should point slightly\\nback and left.\\n64. Slide an orange straight elbow piece onto the left end of the 3 long axles used a few steps ago. This\\npiece\\'s end should also point to the left its middle hole to the top.\\n65. Insert a 10 long black technic axle into the previous piece\\'s left end. This piece\\'s end should also\\npoint to the left. Insert a 6 long red technic axle into the black elbow piece\\'s left/back end so that its end\\nalso points back/left.\\n66. Place two orange technic axle/pinhole pieces, each onto the end of one of the two previous pieces\\nso that the pinholes are oriented vertically. Repeat steps 61-66.\\nYou will now connect the two large wing structures to the body.\\n67. Connect these two technic assemblies to the main assembly by snapping them on using their hinged\\nends. Orient the first technic assembly by pointing its hinged piece to the back and its other ends\\nforward and to the right. Snap it on to the main animal by connecting its hinged piece to the already\\nplaced hinged piece on the second section of the animal. Orient the second technic assembly by\\npointing its hinged piece to the front and its other ends backwards and to the right. Snap it on to the\\nmain animal by connecting its hinged piece to the already placed hinged piece on the second section of\\nthe animal. \\nBuild the two small wing structures:\\n68. Locate a red slight technic elbow piece and orient it so that its ends point to the left and to the back\\nright respectively. Insert a red technic two long axle into each end of the previous piece. Slide an orange\\ntechnic axle connector/pinhole piece onto the right axle of the previous piece, with the pin hole oriented\\nvertically. Slide a black technic axle connecter/snap hinge piece onto the left technic axle of the\\nassembly. The hinge should be oriented vertically. Locate another red slight technic elbow piece and\\norient it so that its ends point to the left and the back right respectively. Insert a red technic two long axle\\ninto each end of the previous piece. Slide an orange technic axle connector/pinhole piece onto the right\\naxle of the previous piece, with the pin hole oriented vertically. Slide a black technic axle connecter/snap\\nhinge piece onto the left technic axle of the assembly. The hinge should be oriented vertically.\\nEssentially, you have two of the same technic assemblies ready. Connect these two technic assemblies\\nto the main assembly by snapping them on using their hinged ends. Orient the first technic assembly by\\npointing its hinged piece to the back and its other ends forward and to the right. Snap it on to the main\\nanimal by connecting its hinged piece to the already placed hinged piece on the middle section of the\\nanimal. Orient the second technic assembly by pointing its hinged piece to the front and its other ends\\nbackwards and to the right. Snap it on to the main animal by connecting its hinged piece to the already\\nplaced hinged piece on the middle section of the animal.\\n69. Insert ten black technic pins/ball joints into each of the ten technic pin holes visible from the top of\\nthe assembly, except for the two black elbow technic pieces, the ones in the middle at the right of the\\nlarge wings. All the ball joints should be pointing up.\\n70. Locate the four wings made from a flexible plastic sheet. They are bright orange, blue and black and\\nhave a natural feather pattern. Connect them by sliding the ball joints from the previous step through the\\nholes in the \"wings\". The bigger two \"wings\" should go in the front, with the rounded edges pointing\\nright. The smaller two \"wings\" should go on the back, with the rounded edges pointing right.\\nYou are done! If you like, you can connect the beast to the base by sliding the axle end of the base\\nthrough the little axle hole in the bottom of the second to last section of the beast. You can also attach\\neither of the minifigures to the other base built in the beginning.\\nThank you so much for building this set!']"}]}

We will start with the chassis of the car! This is the frame which the rest of the car is built upon. Place\\na black 6x8 hollow rectangle brick, horizontally long in front of you.\\n1.2. Place a yellow 2L pin into the center pin hole on the front side of the previous piece, pushing it in\\nfrom the back side so it extends into the hollow rectangle of the previous piece. Place another\\nsymmetrically on the back row.\\n2.1. Skip a pin-hole to the right of the pieces from the previous step, and place two more yellow 2L pins\\non the front and back sides of the 6x8 brick, in the same orientation.\\n2.2. Place a blue 3L pin to the left of the first 2L pin on the front row. With the stop ring at the back, push it\\nin from the back all the way to the stop so it extends evenly to the front and back. Place another\\nsymmetrically on the back row. There should now be two rows of pins extending into the hollow rectangle,\\nwith the first and fourth pin-holes from the left in the hollow rectangle empty.\\n3. Place a black 1x6 brick with pin-holes, horizontally long, on the front row of pins in the solid rectangle.\\nPlace another symmetrically on the back row of pins. The hollow rectangle should now be only two rows\\nwide.\\n4.1. Find the blue 3L pin extending to the front of the chassis. Place two blue 3L pins, with the stop rings\\nat the back, in the pin-holes to the left of the existing 3L pin. They should extend two brick lengths (2L) to\\nthe front.\\n4.2. Place a black 1x16 brick with pin-holes, horizontally long, on the side onto the three pins on the front\\nof the chassis. Push it on from the front, attaching the pins to the rightmost three pin holes on the 1x16\\nbrick.\\nOpen group 2.\\n5.1. Place a black 4x6 hollow rectangle brick, vertically long, in front of you.\\n5.2. Push a black 2L pin into the rightmost hole on the front of the previous piece from the front. Place\\nanother symmetrically on the back.\\n5.3. Push a blue 3L pin into the leftmost hole of the 4x6 brick, with the stop ring at the back so it extends\\n2L to the front. Place another symmetrically on the back.\\n5.4. Keeping the 3L pin on the left, push the pins on this assembly onto the 1x16 brick so its right edge\\ntouches the 6x8 brick from step 1. Push it in from the back side until it touches the 1x16 brick. The 1x16\\nbrick should extend past this piece by 8 studs.\\n6.1. We\u2019re going to extend the chassis some more, so set the main portion of the chassis aside for now.\\nPlace a black 1x6 brick with pin-holes on the side, vertically long, in front of you.\\n6.2. Place a blue 3L pin into the second and fourth holes from the front. Push them in from the left, with\\nthe stop ring at the right so they extend 2L to the left.\\n7. Attach a black 6x8 hollow rectangle brick, horizontally long, to the previous pieces, aligned with the\\nfront and back edges of the 1x6 brick. Push it on from the left so it extends to the left. The 3L pins should\\nextend 1L into the hollow rectangle on this piece.\\n8. Place two red 1x2 bricks with a single pin-hole, vertically long, one onto each of the pins extending into\\nthe right side of the hollow rectangle. Push them on from the left.\\n9.1. Place a red 2x3 plate horizontally long in front of you.\\n9.2. Place a red 1x2 plate, vertically long, on the rightmost column of the previous piece.\\n9.3. Place a light gray 1x2 brick with a pin-hole and a 1x2 plate, with the hole at the front, in the front row\\nof the 2x3, to the left of the previous piece. Attach the plate portion onto the 2x3 plate so the bottoms are\\neven. It should overhang one stud to the front. Place another symmetrically behind the first.\\n9.4. Place a red 2x3 plate, horizontally long and centered vertically, on the pieces from the previous step,\\neven with the left side so it extends onto the 1x2 plate at the right of the assembly.\\n9.5. Keep this orientation, place this assembly into the hollow rectangle on the 6x8 brick from step 7.\\nPush it all the way against the left edge of the hollow rectangle. Attach it by pushing a 3L pin into the\\nsecond pin-hole from the left on the front side, inserting the pin from the front, with the stop ring at the\\nback so it extends 1L to the front. Push in another pin, symmetrically on the back side, to fully attach the\\nassembly. This will form the base for the trunk of the car!\\n10. Place a blue 3L pin, with the stop ring at the back, into the rightmost pin-hole on the front side of this\\nassembly, pushing it in from the front with the stop ring at the back, so it extends 2L to the front. Place\\nanother symmetrically on the back side.\\n11. Put the rest of the chassis in front of you, horizontally long, with the 1x16 brick extending to the left.\\nAttach the new assembly we created to the 1x16 brick by pushing the front pins into the back of the 1x16\\nbrick. The leftmost pin on the new assembly should go into the leftmost hole on the 1x16 brick, so the\\nright edge of the assembly touches the left edge of a 4x6 brick with a hollow rectangle.\\n12. Rotate the chassis 180 degrees so it is still horizontally long, and so the 1x16 brick is at the back.\\nPlace another 1x16 brick with pin-holes on the front side, symmetrically to the one on the back side.\\n13. Place two blue 3L pins into the second and third holes from the left on the previous piece, pushing\\nthem in from the front, with the stop rings at the front. These should extend 1L to the front, and should be\\nsymmetric with a pair of 3L pins on the back side of the chassis.\\nOpen group 3.\\n14.1. Now we\u2019re going to build the drive axle! The 1961 Chevrolet Corvette is a rear wheel drive car, so\\nthis axle sits under the trunk of the car. Build the center portion of the axle by attaching two black 2L\\nstraight axle connectors together using a red 2L axle. Remember that the trunk is on the right of the car\\nas it sits now.\\n14.2. Place the center of the axle into the rightmost hollow area on the chassis. It should be in line with\\nthe fourth hole from the right on the two 1x16 bricks. Push a light gray 7L axle through the 4th hole from\\nthe right, on the front side, while holding the axle connectors in place until the axle slides in. Slide another\\n7L axle in from the back. This is the drive axle!\\n15.1. Place a 3L axle into the pin-hole to the right of the front 7L axle, pushing it in from the front with the\\nstop ring at the back. Place another to the right of the first in the same orientation. Repeat these\\nsymmetrically on the back side of the chassis.\\n15.2.

The stacked pairs are light green, and the loose ones are dark green. There are both left and right\\nwedge plates.\\n50.1. Now we\u2019ll start making the base for the stream that flows through the garden. Place a light green\\n2x3 right wedge plate, with the studs on the right and the wide part at the back, in front of the 1x1 flower\\nplate on the back row of the base. To determine if a wedge plate is a \u201cleft\u201d or a \u201cright\u201d variety, place it\\nhorizontally long in front of you, with the studs in a row at the front. Whichever side is widest, left or right,\\nis the variety of wedge plate it is!\\n50.2.

We\u2019ll build the water one row at a time, building each row from right to\\nleft. For the next few steps, we\u2019ll do things a little bit differently. Because all colors are transparent blue,\\nwe won\u2019t tell you which color to grab! All tiles will be placed horizontally long, so we won\u2019t describe the\\norientation.\\n63.1. The first row, from right to left, is two 1x2 tiles, a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile. The right edges of the first\\n12 rows of the stream are all even.\\n63.2. The second row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, and a 1x1 plate.\\n63.3. The third row, from right to left, is a 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish print, a 1x1 plate, and\\na 1x2 tile.\\n63.4. The fourth row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish print, a 1x1 plate,\\nand a 1x2 tile.\\n63.4. The fifth row, from right to left, is a 1x2 tile and a 1x4 tile.\\n63.5. The sixth row, from right to left, is a 1x4 tile and a 1x2 tile.\\n63.6. The seventh row is exactly like the fifth row. The eighth row is exactly like the sixth row. The ninth\\nrow is another repeat of the fifth row.\\n63.7. The tenth row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile.\\nNow the orientations start to change. Unless otherwise stated, consider all 1x2 tiles as horizontal.\\n64.1. The eleventh row, from right to left, is two 1x2 tiles, a vertical 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile, and a 1x1 plate.\\nThe vertical 1x2 tile is even with the back of the other pieces.\\n64.2. The twelfth row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, a vertical 1x2 tile with a koi fish pattern,\\nskip over the tile from the previous step, a vertical 1x2 tile and a 1x2 tile. The vertical tile is even with the\\nback of the other pieces.\\n64.3. The thirteenth row is offset one stud to the left. This row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a vertical\\n1x2 tile, skip over the tile from the previous step, a vertical 1x2 tile, skip over the tile from the previous\\nstep, and a 1x1 plate.\\n64.4. The fourteenth row, from right to left, is a vertical 1x2 tile, skip over the tile from the previous step, a\\nvertical 1x2 tile, skip over the tile from the previous step, a vertical 1x2 tile, and a 1x2 tile.\\n64.5. The fifteenth row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate between the right two tiles from the fourteenth row,\\nskip over the tile from the previous step, a vertical 1x2 tile, skip over the tile from the previous step, and a\\nvertical 1x2 tile.\\n64.6. The sixteenth row is a 1x1 plate between the left two tiles from the fifteenth row.\\nLet\u2019s take a second to check out our stream so far. From right to left, the first six columns should be\\nunbroken columns of twelve, fifteen, fifteen, fifteen, sixteen, and sixteen. The seventh column from the\\nright should have a short column of three at the back and six at the front, with seven exposed studs\\nbetween. The eighth column should be a partial column with a column of two, then a single.\\nThe stream now turns ninety degrees to the left. We\u2019ll start making this turn by working from the twelfth\\nrow of the stream, and working towards the front. Because the pieces aren\u2019t nicely horizontal anymore,\\nwe aren\u2019t able to just move in a row from left to right.\\n65.1. Now we will extend the twelfth row. From right to left, a 1x1 plate, a vertical 1x2 tile, and a 1x2 tile.\\nPlace a light gray 1x1 circular tile behind the left stud of the last piece of this row.\\n65.2. Extend the thirteenth row, from right to left, a 1x2 tile, skip over the tile from the previous step, and a\\n1x2 tile.\\n65.3. Extend the fourteenth row, from right to left, a 1x2 tile, skip over the flower plate, and a vertical 1x2\\ntile.\\n65.4. Extend the fifteenth row, from right to left, a 1x2 tile, and a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish pattern.\\n65.5. Extend the sixteenth row, from right to left, a 1x1 plate, a vertical 1x2 tile, and two 1x2 tiles.\\n65.6. The seventeenth row is a brand new row which starts in front of the right 1x1 from the previous row.\\nFrom right to left, it is a vertical 1x2 tile, skip over the tile from the previous step, a vertical 1x2 tile, and a\\n1x2 tile.\\n65.7. The eighteenth row, from right to left, skip over the first tile from the previous step, a 1x1 plate, skip\\nover the tile from the previous step, a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile.\\n65.8. The nineteenth row is offset two studs to the left from the previous row and, from right to left, is a\\nvertical 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with a white koi fish pattern, and a vertical 1x2 tile.\\n65.9. The twentieth row is a 1x2 tile between the two vertical tiles from the previous step.\\n65.10. The twenty-first row is two 1x2 tiles.\\n65.11. The twenty-second row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile.\\nNow let\u2019s take a quick look at how the stream is shaping up. The stream should now have 22 rows, and\\nthere should be one row of exposed studs at the front of the base, and one at the back. Row 22 (at the\\nfront of the build) should have fourteen exposed studs to the left of it. Row 21 should have thirteen\\nexposed studs to the left of it. Rows 12-15 and row 17 should be even with row 22. Rows 16 and rows 18-\\n20 should be even with row 21.\\n66.1. Extend the twenty-second row to the left with three 1x2 tiles.\\n66.2. Now, we are going to change things up and work from left to right in columns. Almost all of the tiles\\nin these columns will be vertically long, so use that orientation unless stated otherwise. First, place a\\nhorizontal 1x2 tile behind the left tile from the previous piece so its left edge is even with the 1x1 flower\\nplate behind it. Extend this column, from front to back, with three 1x2 tiles. The right edges of this column\\nshould all be even.\\n66.3. The next column to the right, from front to back, is three 1x2 tiles, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish,\\nand a 1x2 tile.\\n66.4. The next column to the right, from front to back, is a horizontal 1x2 tile, four 1x2 tiles, and a light\\ngray 1x1 circular tile.\\n66.5. The next column to the right, starting behind the horizontal tile from the previous step and going\\nfrom front to back, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, skip over the 1x1 flower plate, a horizontal 1x2 tile, a 1x1\\nplate, and two horizontal 1x2 tiles.\\n66.6. The next column to the right, from front to back, is a 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish, a\\nhorizontal 1x2 tile, skip over the tile from the previous step, and a horizontal 1x2 tile.\\n66.7, Place a 1x2 tile behind the previous piece so the right edges are even. Place another behind the\\nfirst.\\nHang on! We\u2019re almost done with the stream! Now, let\u2019s take stock of our creek again. Row 22 should\\nhave eight exposed studs to the left of it. Row 21 should only have seven. All of the other rows should be\\neven with row 22. For the next few steps, we will be building columns from left to right. Again, most of the\\ntiles in these columns will be vertically long, so use that orientation unless stated otherwise.\\n67.1. The first column we\u2019ll build is on the second column from the left on the base. From front to back,\\nskipping over the front stud on the base, make a column of five 1x2 tiles. The front edges of all\\nsubsequent columns will be even with this one.\\n67.2. The second column, from front to back, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with a white koi fish, two\\n1x2 tiles, and a horizontally long light gray 1x6 tile which extends to the right.\\n67.3. The third column, from front to back, is a 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish, two 1x2 tiles,\\nand a light gray 1x1 circular plate.\\n67.4. The fourth column, from front to back, is a horizontal 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile, a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, skip\\nover the 1x1 flower plate, and a 1x2 tile.\\n67.5. The fifth column, from front to back, is four 1x2 tiles behind the tile from the previous step.\\n67.6. The sixth column, from front to back, is four 1x2 tiles, and a light gray 1x1 circular tile.\\n67.7. The last column, from front to back, is a 1x1 plate, skip over the tile and the 1x1 flower plate, and\\nthree 1x2 tiles. There should now be one exposed row of studs to the left of the stream, and one in front\\nof it. The front and left edges of the stream should be unbroken lines of tiles and plates.\\nOpen group 21.\\n68.1. Now we\u2019ll build some water lilies for the stream. Place a green 2x2 dish in front of you, with the stud\\non top.\\n68.2. Place a purple five pointed leaf on the previous piece.\\n68.3. Place an orange 1x1 round tile with vertical ribs onto the stud inside the petals of the previous\\npiece. That\u2019s one water lily complete!\\n68.4. Repeat steps 68.1-68.3 three more times to make a total of four water lilies.\\n68.5. Now we\u2019ll place the lilies. Starting on the back row of the stream, find the four studs which alternate\\nleft and right, with tiles on either side of them. Place one lilly on the second stud from the back. There\\nshould be a horizontal tile to the left and right of this lilly.\\n68.6. Now, feel straight in front of the previous lilly until you find another stud in the middle of the stream.\\nThis is right where the stream starts to turn left. Place a lilly on this stud. There should be a horizontal tile\\nto the left and right of this lilly.\\n68.7. To place the next lilly, trace the left side of the vertical portion of the stream from back to front until\\nthe stream curves, then continue a little ways until you find a stud. Place a lilly on this stud. This should\\nbe in front of, and to the left of the previous lilly by a little bit.\\n68.8. The last lilly is on the front left portion of the stream. Find the two studs on the front row of the\\nstream. Then find the column of two studs between them. Place the last lilly on the front stud.

Place one support on each of these 1x1 flower\\nplates. Angle the supports so the flat faces are all parallel with the imaginary lines between the first and\\nsecond flower plates, and the second, third, and fourth flower plates.\\n120.4. Now we will place the tall supports for the tea room. The tea room is placed at an angle on single\\nstuds. The first four supports will be placed in the stream. The first support goes on the stud which is in\\nthe stream behind the far left water lilly.\\n120.5. The second support goes on the first stud to the right of the front left water lilly. This is between the\\nwater lilly and the first lantern.\\n120.6. Continue to the right of the second support until you find a lantern (if you did not place the lanterns\\nyet this will just be a stud). There should be two studs behind this lantern/stud. Place the third support on\\nthe first one.\\n120.7. Continue behind the second support until you find the stud, then move right. You will find a rock.\\nFind the stud which is just behind and to the right of the rock. Place the last tall support on this stud.\\n120.5. Find the three 2x2 angled slope bricks behind the stream. The first is on the leftmost column in\\nfront of a tree. The second is to the right of the stack of 4x4 tiles with rounded corners. The third is just to\\nthe left of the two trees to the left of the bridge. Place a brown 1x1 brick on each of these pieces.\\n121. Now, rotate the garden 180 degrees so it is horizontally long and the bridge is closer to the front.\\nNow, we\u2019ll attach the tea room to the support we placed. Place the tea room in front of you, with the entry\\nat the front right. Rotate it so it is in line with the supports from the previous two steps and attach it to\\nthem. It should be at close to a 45 degree angle to the rest of the garden. When placed, it should\\noverhang the supports by half a stud on all four sides. Once the tea room is attached, carefully rotate the\\nsupports so their flat faces are parallel to the walls of the tea room. The 4x4 tiles with rounded corners\\nshould lead up to the entryway like a staircase.\\nOpen bag 10.\\nSub-build 1 - First deciduous tree\\nOpen group 43.\\n122.1.

One final panel on the top of the box shows\\nthe crew bringing the treasure ashore with the turtles watching and the hammerhead shark jumping out\\nthe water in the distance.\\n- There are a total of 182 pieces in this build, and 79 steps split across three building phases.']"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['Let\u2019s start by putting together the male diver minifigure. Construct the minifigure using the legs, torso,\\nscuba tank and head. Take the helmet piece and clip the goggles over the face-hole, making sure that the\\nsnorkel that\u2019s part of the goggles slopes up. A light blond hair piece is included to replace the helmet for\\nwhen he\u2019s not diving. Connect an orange flipper to each foot. The only thing left is to give him an\\naccessory! Take the blue minifigure camera and place a light grey 1x1 round plate with hole on the stud in\\nthe camera\u2019s center. Then place a transparent clear 1x1 round tile on top of the 1x1 round plate. Clip the\\ncamera into the minifigure\u2019s hand using the bar on the side of the camera. Collect the grey-blue stingray\\nto give him something to photograph!\\nOur intrepid diver sports a dark blue wetsuit with light blue arms and orange accents, completed with an\\norange scuba tank and matching orange flippers. His face shows a wistful smile, as if he is admiring the\\nmajestic sea creatures around him. His head is covered by a dark blue diving helmet and transparent\\nblue goggles with a snorkel. In his hand he carries a waterproof camera with which to document the\\nwonders of the ocean. The stingray is a large, flat creature with small eyes on the sides of its head and a\\npattern of dark blue spots over its winglike fins. Despite their reputation, stingrays are gentle creatures,\\nonly stinging in defense when they feel attacked. So long as our photographer keeps his distance, he\u2019s\\nperfectly safe!\\nNow we can build the minisub!\\n1. Take a blue 2x4 plate and orient it horizontally.\\n2. Next, collect a white 1x2 brick with pinhole and place it vertically on the leftmost column of the plate.\\n3. Find another white 1x2 brick with pinhole and connect it vertically to the immediate right of the previous\\nbrick.\\n4. Gather two light grey 1x2 bricks with vertical bar handles on the ends. Take the first and place it\\nvertically on the back stud of the column to the right of the previous part so that the bar points away from\\nyou and the piece overhangs by one stud to the back. Place the second piece symmetrically.\\n5. Place an orange 1x2 brick with pinhole vertically to the left of the pieces from the previous step.\\n6. Take a blue 2x4 plate and connect it horizontally to the top of the minisub. The plate should not\\noverhang in any direction.\\n7. Find two tan axle-with-pin pieces. Insert the pin ends into the holes in the bricks with pinholes at the left\\nand right ends of the model.\\n8. Take the black 12-tooth gear and connect it to the tan axle protruding from the left end of the minisub.\\nThe gear represents the minisub\u2019s propeller and can spin freely.\\n9. Find two blue modified 1x2 plates with a bar handle on one side. Orient the first horizontally with the\\nbar handle facing away from you. Connect it to the back row of studs to the right of the gear. Place the\\nsecond piece symmetrically. There should be an empty 2x2 of studs to the right of the modified plates.\\n10. Next, take two white lamp holders \u2013 these parts have a single stud with a thick ring protruding from\\nthe side, and the ring has a stud on either side. Place them symmetrically to the right of the modified\\nplates with bar handles so that the thick rings align with the bar handles.\\n11. Find a dark blue round 2x2 tile with center stud and connect it to the 2x2 of studs between the bar\\nhandles. Then, collect an orange 2x2 curved slope and orient it so the slope curves down to the right.\\nThis part is decorated with the explorers\u2019 logo, a blue planet Earth with dark blue continents surrounded\\nby a ring with four spikes that is reminiscent of a compass. Connect the slope to the right of the dark blue\\nround tile.\\n12. Locate the transparent blue 2x2 round dome piece and hold it with the top stud facing right. Connect it\\nto the tan axle protruding from the right end of the minisub\u2019s body.\\n13. Make two identical parts: collect two orange 1x1 round bricks and two clear 1x1 round tiles. Connect a\\nround tile to the stud of each round brick. Then, orient the parts on their sides with the round tiles facing to\\nthe right. Connect the parts to the exposed side studs of the lamp holder pieces on either side of the\\ncurved slope. Now the minisub has lights that it can use when exploring the depths!\\n14. Make another two parts: gather two white robot arms and two light grey bars with clips. Insert the grey\\nbars into the holes in the ends of the robot arms. Attach the arms by clipping the ends of the white robot\\narms to the vertical bar handles protruding from the sides of the minisub. Make sure that each robot arm\\ncan hinge all the way forward \u2013 if it can\u2019t, then flip the arm and reconnect it.\\nWell done, you have finished the minisub and the first of the three bags! The minisub is a small,\\nunmanned vehicle equipped with powerful headlights and robotic arms which can collect samples and\\nassist divers underwater. The bars behind the lights are perfect for a minifigure to hitch a ride!\\nOpen bag 2.\\nAssemble the pilot minifigure using the legs, torso, life jacket, head, and hair. Under her life jacket, the\\nresearcher is wearing a white jacket with blue arms. She has a portable GPS unit attached to her belt.\\nShe has a slight smile and wrinkles around her mouth and eyes which imply her experience as a pilot and\\nas an explorer. Her hair is long and black, braided and tied back.\\nNext, assemble the hammerhead shark by clipping the head onto the body. The hammerhead is a light\\ngrey shark with an unusually shaped head which they use to find their favorite food \u2013 stingrays!\\nLet\u2019s build the explorer\u2019s diving boat!\\n1. Take the dark blue boat element and orient it horizontally with the rounded end pointing to the right.\\n2. Collect a white 1x6 arch piece and connect it vertically to the leftmost column of recessed studs.\\n3. Locate two white tail pieces \u2013 these pieces have a 1x2 of studs on the top connected by a thin sloping\\npanel to a 1x4 area at the bottom. Orient the pieces horizontally so they slope down to the left. Connect\\none to the back row of recessed studs to the immediate right of the arch piece from the previous step and\\nconnect the other to the front row of studs in the same fashion.\\n4. Find the white 1x4 fence piece and orient it vertically with the raised section facing right. Connect it\\nbetween the tail pieces from the previous step so that the fence piece is aligned with the right edges of\\nthe tail pieces.\\n5. Take the light grey crate piece and orient it vertically. Place it to the immediate right of the fence piece.\\nThere should be a row of empty studs in front of and behind the crate.\\n6. Collect a tan 1x2 sloped tile and orient it vertically sloping down to the right. Place it to the right of the\\ncrate and in the center of the column so that there are two empty studs above and below the slope. Then\\ntake the white steering wheel and place it vertically two studs to the right of the sloped tile. The steering\\nwheel should be centered in the same way as the slope.\\n7. To the right of the steering wheel should be an empty 2x2 studded area that is raised up by one plate\\nthickness. Place an orange 2x2 plate in this space.\\n8. Find two white 1x2 grille slopes, which have a grille-like texture on the sloped surface. Orient them\\nhorizontally sloping down to the right. Now place your finger on the 2x2 of empty studs to the immediate\\nleft of the steering wheel. Moving your finger vertically towards you, you should meet the side of the boat\\nand find a raised 2x2 region of empty studs. Place a grille slope on the inner horizontal 1x2 of studs.\\nConnect the second grille slope symmetrically to the back of the build.\\n9. Take two tan 1x3 bricks and orient them horizontally. Place the first on the first row of the recessed\\narea inside the boat so that the left edge of the piece is aligned with the left end of the grille slope from\\nthe last step. Place the second piece symmetrically to the other side. There should be a vertical space of\\nfour studs between the bricks.\\n10. Locate two dark blue 1x3 bricks and stack them horizontally on top of the bricks from the previous\\nstep.\\n11. Get a tan 2x2 brick and place it on the 2x2 of studs to the right of the steering wheel.\\n12. Find the dark blue 3x6 wedge plate with cut corners and orient it vertically so that the long edge of the\\npiece lies to the left. Connect it to the tan 2x2 brick from the last step so that the left edge touches the\\nright ends of the dark blue 1x3 bricks from two steps back.\\n13. Gather two transparent blue 1x2 bricks and two blue 1x2 sloped bricks. Orient the pieces horizontally\\nwith the slopes facing to the right. Place a 1x2 brick on the front dark blue 1x3 brick\u2019s left two studs \u2013 the\\npiece should be vertically aligned with the white 1x2 grille slope in front of it. To the right of the brick, place\\nthe 1x2 sloped brick. Place the other two parts symmetrically on the back of the model.\\n14. Take the grey 1x2 sloped tile decorated with printed dashboard and orient it vertically with the slope\\nfacing to the left. Place it directly to the right of the steering wheel element. The dashboard features two\\ndials which could represent speedometers, pressure gauges, or other measurements. To the right of the\\ndashboard, place a grey 2x2 tile.\\n15. Collect two grey 1x2 panels with sides and two white 1x2 panels with center divider. Take the first\\npanel with sides and orient it horizontally with the open side facing you. Locate a 2x2 area of empty studs\\non the front left edge of the boat \u2013 this area is in front of one of the white fins placed in step 3. Place the\\npanel with sides on the inner row of studs. Then, take a white panel with center divider and orient it\\nhorizontally with the center divider pointing towards you. Place the piece in front of the previous part.\\nConnect the other two pieces symmetrically to the opposite side of the boat. An interesting feature of the\\npanel with center divider is that the divider slides neatly between a minifigure\u2019s legs, allowing you to pose\\na minifigure on the side of the boat \u2013 perhaps this is where the minifigures stand before their dive! Also\\nnote that the panels come together to create a small storage box where you can place minifigure\\naccessories such as tools or diving flippers.\\n16. Find two white modified 1x2 plates with two horizontal clips and a grey modified 1x2 plate with vertical\\nbar arm. Locate an empty vertical 1x6 studded region at the far left of the boat and place the modified\\nplate with vertical bar arm vertically on the middle two studs with the bar arm to the left. Then, attach the\\nmodified plates with clips behind and in front of the previous piece so the clips point to the left. We will\\nreturn to this area later to add engines and a crane!\\n17. Take two orange 2x6 plates and orient them vertically. Place the first on top of the pieces from the\\nprevious step, locking them in place. Locate the fins to the right and identify the two horizontal 1x2\\nstudded areas at the top of the fins. Connect the second orange plate across the fins.\\n18. Locate two orange 1x10 curved slopes. Orient the pieces horizontally with the studs to the left and the\\nslope curving down to the right. Connect the first slope to the front row of the 2x6 plate from the previous\\nstep so that the right end of the slope connects to the brick and slope in front of the cockpit area. The\\ncurved slope should overhang to the left of the 2x6 plate by two studs. Connect the second slope in the\\nsame way to the back row of the plate.\\n19. Grab a blue 2x4 plate and place it vertically on the orange 2x6 plate between the 1x10 curved slopes.\\n20. Collect a black 1x4 plate and grey 1x4 hinge plate with two fingers on the side. Orient the pieces\\nvertically, with the fingers of the hinge plate pointing to the right. Connect the black 1x4 plate to the left\\ncolumn of the blue 2x4 plate from the last step and connect the hinge plate to the right column.\\n21. Gather three orange 1x2 plates with center stud. Orient the first two plates horizontally and place\\nthem on the 1x2 studded areas at the left end of the 1x10 curved slopes. Orient the last plate vertically.\\nLocate a vertical 1x2 studded area at the far right of the boat, right at the end, and place the plate here.\\n22. Find three grey round 1x1 plates with holes. Place one on each of the plates with center stud from the\\nlast step.\\n23. Let\u2019s return to the 2x4 studded area between the two long curved slopes. Locate two white 1x2 tiles\\nand orient them horizontally. Place them on the back and front rows of studs, leaving a 2x2 studded area\\nbetween them. Then, find a white mast element \u2013 this piece has a 2x2 square base with a vertical mast\\nrising from the center. The mast branches to either side, with each branch terminating in a stud. The top\\nof the mast also has a single stud. Orient the piece with the smooth side of the mast faces to the right and\\nthe mast slopes back towards the left. Connect the piece between the 1x2 tiles.\\n24. The placement of the next three 1x1 round translucent tiles is fully dependent on knowing which tile is\\nwhich color. Reach out to a sighted friend or family member to help you identify each one and place them\\nas follows: place the transparent red 1x1 round tile on the stud on the back branch of the mast, the\\ntransparent clear 1x1 round tile on the stud at the top of the mast, and the transparent green tile 1x1\\nround tile on the stud on the front branch of the mast.\\n25. Now we\u2019ll return to the boat\u2019s rear. Find the orange 2x6 plate at the far-left end of the boat. Take two\\ngrey modified 1x2 plates with clip on top and orient them horizontally with the clips on the right. Place the\\npieces on the front two rows of the orange 2x6 plate.\\n26. Locate the light blue syringe minifigure accessory and connect it to the clips. Then, find a white 1x2\\ntile with medical sign and place it vertically across the studs to the left of the clips. The tile features a bluegreen asterisk symbol like many medical signs. Perhaps the syringe is for medical use only, containing a\\nlife-saving antidote, or maybe the tile itself is a first-aid kit and the syringe is for taking samples. You\\ndecide!\\nNow we\u2019ll build the two outboard motors which power the diving boat. We will build them as two identical\\nparts and connect them to the boat soon, so set aside the boat for now.\\n27. Take two orange 2x2 plates.\\n28. Collect two blue modified 1x2 plates with bar handles on the side and connect one to the top of each\\n2x2 plate. Orient both parts with the bar handles to the right.\\n29. Take two blue 2x2 curved slopes and orient them so the slopes curve down to the left. Connect them\\nto the parts so all the studs are covered.\\n30. Grab two white modified 2x2 plates with pin hole underneath. Orient them so the pin hole points to the\\nleft. Place the parts from the previous step on top of the modified plates.\\n31. Gather two tan Technic axles with pins and insert the pins into the pin holes.\\n32. Finish the parts by connecting a black 12-tooth gear to each Technic axle.\\n33. Connect the parts to the clips protruding from the rear of the boat. The outboard motors can be angled\\nup or down, and the black gears represent propellers which can spin freely.\\nNext, we will build the crane! Again, this will be built as a separate part.\\n34. Find a black 1x4 plate and orient it horizontally.\\n35. Gather two black 1x2 hinge plates with two fingers and orient them horizontally, with one having the\\nfingers to the left and the other having the fingers to the right. Place them on top of the 1x4 plate so that\\nthe fingers overhang to the left and right of the plate.\\n36. Take a blue 1x4 tile with black danger stripes and place it on top of the part. The danger stripes warn\\nthat people should be careful around this heavy machinery!\\n37. Locate a white 1x2 hinge plate with one finger and orient it horizontally with the finger to the right.\\nConnect it to the subassembly by pushing the finger between the two black fingers until you hear a \u2018click\u2019.\\n38. Find a silver chain \u2013 this piece has two single studs connected by chain links. Connect one end of the\\nchain to the left stud of the hinge plate from the previous step.\\n39. Secure the chain by covering the studs with a blue 1x2 curved slope piece oriented horizontally and\\ncurving down to the right.\\n40. At the right end of the crane arm, connect a dark grey hinge cylinder with one finger and an axle hole.\\n41. Add the crane to the boat by locating the vertical bar arm between the motors and sliding the bar into\\nthe axle hole of the hinge cylinder. The crane can swing from side to side and bend up or down. The stud\\non the end of the chain can be connected to the stud on the back of the minisub to carry it to and from the \\nwater, or it can be attached to a minifigure\u2019s hand to help them back onto the boat. Perhaps it could even\\nbe used as a giant fishing pole to lure the hammerhead shark!\\n42. Let\u2019s put together the boat\u2019s windscreen. Take the transparent blue windscreen element and orient it\\nhorizontally with the studded 2x4 surface to the left. Next, find the orange 2x4 tile with the printed\\nExplorers logo and place it over the windscreen\u2019s studs. Connect the windscreen to the boat by finding\\nthe two fingers below and to the right of the mast and inserting them into the fingers on the left edge of\\nthe windscreen. The parts are connected when you hear a \u2018click\u2019. The windscreen can hinge open so you\\ncan access the cockpit and interior.\\n43. Gather three black bars with stud and three transparent clear 1x1 round tiles. Place a tile on each\\nstud to create three lights. Add the lights to the boat by inserting the bars into the three light grey round\\n1x1 plates with holes \u2013 one can be found at the front of the boat, to the right of the windscreen, and the\\nother two can be found at the left ends of the 1x10 curved slopes that lie either side of the windscreen.\\nTwist the lights in place so that the tiles face out from the boat to illuminate the surroundings.\\nCongratulations, you have finished building the diving boat! This sleek vessel is perfect for reaching\\nremote locations and dive sites, and is fully equipped with powerful engines, lights, a crane, and a\\nmedical bay. Inside the boat is a crate for storing equipment and a cockpit with steering wheel and\\ndashboard. On the boat\u2019s sides are two places for divers to stand immediately before beginning their\\nundersea adventure. A graphic at the end of the instruction booklet shows the pilot minifigure holding the\\nsyringe at the rear of the boat as the hammerhead cruises by.\\nOpen bag 3.\\nAssemble the female diver minifigure using the legs, torso, orange scuba tank, and head. Make her\\nhelmet by clipping the transparent blue goggles over the dark blue helmet, making sure that the snorkel is\\nsloping up. Finish by giving the diver her flippers, which will help her swim more easily. The diver\u2019s attire\\nis the same as her companion\u2019s: she wears a dark blue wetsuit accented with orange and lighter blue\\narms. Her eyebrows are angled, and her mouth is half-closed in an expression of determination \u2013 diving\\nis a difficult task! Turning her head around reveals a worried expression. Maybe she\u2019s afraid of sharks! A\\nbright blue hairpiece is included for when the diver is on dry land.\\nTwo sea turtles are included, one being a large turtle and the other being much smaller. Both turtles have\\nlight brown shells and bright green skin. The large turtle has a 2x2 area on its belly which can attach to a\\nstudded surface, and a single stud in the middle of its back. The small turtle can be placed on the back of\\nthe big turtle using the 1x1 connection point on its belly.\\nFor the final build of the set, we\u2019ll create a colorful coral reef!\\n1. Take a dark tan 6x6 round plate and place it in front of you.\\n2. Collect a tan 2x2 brick and place it on the back two rows of the center column of studs.\\n3. Locate two blue 1x2 sloped bricks. Orient the first horizontally with the slope facing left and place it in\\nfront of the 2x2 brick from the previous step so that the studs should form a Braille letter Q. Take the\\nsecond sloped brick and orient it horizontally with the slope facing right and place it to the right of the first\\nslope.\\n4. Gather two lime green 1x1 flower plates (these pieces are similar to 1x1 round plates and have five\\nsmall petals around the edge). Place them on either side of the slopes from the previous step to cover the\\nremaining studs in the row. Then, take a gold 1x1 round tile with crown coin pattern and place it in front of\\nthe right sloped brick. There should be two empty studs to the right and three to the left of the tile. The tile\\nis printed with a crown like an ancient coin \u2013 perhaps this is the treasure the divers seek?\\n5. Find a dark orange 2x2 modified plate with single center stud and place it in the middle column of studs\\nin front of the coin tile from the last step.\\n6. Take the large arch piece and orient it horizontally. Connect the left end of the arch piece to the single\\nstud lying to the right of the 2x2 brick at the back of the round plate.\\n7. Collect a magenta 3x3 round corner plate and orient it with the round corner in the lower right. Secure\\nthe arch piece in place by connecting the corner plate to the studded region formed by the 2x2 brick, two\\nsloped bricks, and the arch piece. The plate should not overhang the build to the back or to the left.\\n8. Next we will build the base for the other end of the arch. Take the dark tan 6x6 round plate and connect\\na tan 2x2 brick at the back and in the middle of the plate. Then, find two blue 1x2 sloped bricks. Orient the\\nfirst horizontally with the slope facing to the left and connect it in front of the 2x2 brick so that the studs\\nform the Braille letter Q. Place the second sloped brick horizontally to the right of the first sloped brick with\\nthe slope facing to the right. Finally, connect the part to the rest of the build by connecting the right end of\\nthe arch piece to the stud to the left of the 2x2 brick. With the basic structure in place, we can start\\nmaking it look alive!\\n9. Find two lime green 1x1 flower plates and place them on either side of the sloped bricks. The flower\\nplates should be horizontally in line with the sloped bricks.\\n10. Make a part: take a 2x2 round dome brick and connect a star piece to the stud on top. This part could\\nbe any number of sea creatures \u2013 is it an interesting coral, or an enormous anemone, or even a sea\\nsponge? Maybe it\u2019s a new species entirely! Place the part in front of the sloped bricks in the middle of the\\nround plate.\\n11. Locate a magenta 3x3 round corner plate and orient it with the round corner in the lower left. Place the\\ncorner plate on top of the 2x2 brick, sloped bricks, and arch piece to firmly secure them.\\n12. Take two dark orange 2x2 modified plates with single center stud. Place the first on the round corner\\nplate from the last step so that it covers the 2x2 of studs directly to the right of the arch piece. Connect\\nthe second symmetrically at the left end of the arch.\\n13. Grab another pair of lime green 1x1 flower plates and place them on the center studs of the pieces\\nfrom the last step.\\n14. Find a coral pink 2x6 plate with two rounded corners and orient it horizontally with the rounded\\ncorners towards you. Connect the piece to the middle of the arch so that it overhangs to the front by one\\nstud. There should be an empty stud on either side of the piece. This addition resembles a shelf of neon\\npink coral.\\n15. To the right of the plate, place a brown 1x1 round plate with bar handle so that the bar handle faces\\nyou.\\n16. Let\u2019s add some plants to the scene! Locate a green seaweed piece \u2013 this piece has four vertical\\nfronds which branch away from the base. Orient the seaweed piece horizontally with the long fronds\\nrising upwards. Insert the small bar at the base of the piece into the hole in the top of the flower plate at\\nthe far left of the build. Next, find a green plant stem \u2013 this piece feels like a thick bar with a curled end.\\nPlace the plant stem on the far right flower plate. The scene is really coming alive now!\\n17. Return to the middle of the arch. Locate an orange 1x2 plate with single center stud and place it\\nacross the brown 1x1 plate with bar handle and the coral pink 2x6 rounded plate. Two studs to the left,\\nconnect a pink 1x1 round tile with bar sticking up from the center.\\n18. Find a green minifigure mop piece \u2013 this part has a bar hole in the top and textured sides flowing\\ndown to rounded protrusions at the end, like the ropes of a mophead. Turn the piece upside-down and \\nconnect the bar hole to the pink tile with bar from the last step. The piece makes for a convincing clump of\\nseagrass! To the right, connect a bright light orange crab to the orange 1x2 plate with center stud. (The\\ncrab\u2019s claws can hold minifigure accessories and bars, and there is a place at the back of the crab where\\na minifigure can grab the crustacean!)\\n19. Let\u2019s build a piece of coral! Collect the coral pink coral piece and orient it with the single stud on top\\nfacing away from you. Take a light grey bar with clip and insert the bar into the hollow stud in the upper\\nright. Then clip the light blue fish onto the part. Orient the fish however you like! Finally, add the coral to\\nthe reef by inserting the bar at the bottom of the piece into flower plate at the left end of the arch.\\n20. Now we will make a second piece of coral to place at the other end of the arch. Collect the next group\\nof pieces. Find the turquoise coral piece and orient it with the top stud away from you. Take a light grey\\nbar with clip and insert it into the upper right hollow stud. Add another fish, this time a light yellowish\\ngreen, by attaching the tail to the bar with clip. Finish by inserting the bar at the base of the coral piece\\ninto the flower plate at the right end of the arch.\\n21. The crown coin isn\u2019t the only treasure to be found here \u2013 we\u2019re about to add a treasure chest! Collect\\nthe brown treasure chest bottom and the brown lid. Orient the chest bottom horizontally with the lower\\nwall at the back and hold the lid horizontally with the protruding nub in the front. Build the treasure chest\\nby aligning the lid on top with the nub inside the chest and lying against the front wall. Push down on the\\nback of the lid until you hear a \u2018click\u2019. The lid of the chest should be able to hinge open. Gather three gold\\n1x1 tiles with crown coin decoration and a gold goblet to stash inside the chest. Then place the assembly\\non the dark orange 2x2 plate with single center stud on the left of the arch for the divers to find!\\n22. Make a part: collect the brown ship\u2019s wheel and a dark grey clip with bar holder. Insert one of the\\nwheel\u2019s spokes into the bar holder and orient the clip so that is vertical with respect to the wheel. Attach\\nthe part to the brown 1x1 round plate with bar handle underneath the crab on the top of the arch. Hinge\\nthe part down until it rests on the building surface. The presence of the wooden ship\u2019s wheel suggests\\nthat the treasure is the result of a shipwreck \u2013 maybe the rest of the ship is nearby!\\nCongratulations, you have finished building the coral reef! The reef is a vivid and vibrant place, brimming\\nwith life in the form of fish, crabs, coral and sea plants like seaweed and seagrass. An illustration at the\\nend of the instructions shows our intrepid diver finding the treasure, which has scattered over the ocean\\nfloor. The small turtle sits beneath the ship\u2019s wheel \u2013 is it hiding, or is it trapped? Surely the divers will\\nhelp! The large turtle swims nearby, keeping close watch of the smaller creature.\\nThe very last page of the instruction booklet shows the whole set. The male diver stands on the edge of\\nthe diving boat, camera in hand, ready to take the plunge. The minisub approaches the reef, where the\\nfemale diver has found the treasure chest and investigates from a distance. The reef teems with life as\\nfish swim past, a crab perches atop the coral arch, and a stingray glides by. A pair of turtles slowly drift\\nthrough the arch, and a hammerhead shark lurks in the distance.\\nThank you so much for building this set!']"}]}

Kennedy challenged his country to safely send and return an\\nAmerican to the Moon before the end of the decade. NASA met that challenge with the Apollo program. It\\nwould be the first time human beings left Earth orbit and visited another world. The Apollo program played\\na crucial role in space exploration and made it possible to explore more distant worlds further in the\\nfuture.\\nThe Apollo program consisted of 11 spaceflights. The first two missions, Apollo 7 and 9, were Earthorbiting missions used to test the Command and Lunar Modules. The next two, Apollo 8 and 10, tested\\nvarious components while orbiting the Moon, also taking photographs of the lunar surface. While Apollo\\n13 did not land on the moon due to a malfunction, a total of six other missions did and returned with a\\nwealth of scientific data and almost 881.8 lbs (400 kilos) of lunar samples.\\nThe first manned mission to the moon was Apollo 8. It circled around the moon on Christmas Eve in\\n1968. Just over six months later on July 20, 1969, the world witnessed one of the most astounding\\ntechnological achievements of the 20th century when a NASA astronaut on Apollo 11 became the first\\nhuman to set foot on the Moon.\\nThe Apollo 11 mission lasted 195 hours, 18 minutes and 35 seconds - about 36 minutes longer than\\nplanned. After lunar orbit insertion, the Command Module (CM) and Lunar Module (LM) separated. While\\none crewmember remained in the CM, which orbited the Moon, the other two astronauts made the\\nhistoric journey to the lunar surface in the LM. After exploring the surface and setting up experiments for\\n21 hours and 36 minutes, the astronauts returned safely to the CM and began the journey back to Earth.\\nSaturn V\\nSaturn V was the most powerful rocket that had ever flown successfully and was used in the Apollo\\nprogram in the 1960s and 1970s. The rocket was 363 ft. (111 m) tall and weighed 6.2 million lbs (2.8\\nmillion kilos) when fully fueled for liftoff. The Saturn V used for the later Apollo missions had three stages.\\nEach stage would burn its engines until it was out of fuel and would then separate from the rocket. The\\nengines on the next stage would fire, and the rocket would continue into space. The first stage had the\\nmost powerful engines, since it had the challenging task of lifting the fully fueled rocket off the ground.\\nThe first stage lifted the rocket to an altitude of about 42 miles (68 km). The second stage carried it from\\nthere almost into orbit. The third stage placed the Apollo spacecraft into Earth orbit and pushed it toward\\nthe moon.\\nTransposition, docking, and extraction\\nShortly after the trans-lunar injection maneuver that placed the Apollo spacecraft on its trajectory towards\\nthe Moon, the transposition and docking maneuver would be performed. This involved an astronaut\\nseparating the Apollo Command/Service Module (CSM) spacecraft from the adapter which fastened it to\\nits launch vehicle upper stage, turning it around, and docking its nose to the Apollo Lunar Module (LM),\\nthen pulling the combined spacecraft away from the upper stage.\\nFan designers\\nWith a shared passion for both space exploration and LEGO\u00ae building, Val\u00e9rie Roche (aka\\nWhatsuptoday) and Felix Stiessen (aka Saabfan) worked closely together to create their impressive\\nApollo 11 Mission model for LEGO Ideas.\\n\u201cThe most challenging part was the Lunar Landing module. I (Felix) tried building it as small as possible (I\\nwanted it to fit in the half-cone parts as seen in the model) while still looking good and accurate. After\\nthat, we began building the rocket around it. We also tried to make the rocket as sound as possible, so\\nVal\u00e9rie included pillars and beams inside for structural integrity.\u201d\\n\u201cIt actually took quite a long time to finish the whole model. There were often times when one of us just\\nabandoned the project for a few weeks and came back to it later; however, thanks to the fact that it is a\\ncollaborative project, it was always the case that one of us continued making progress on the project and\\nre-motivated the other. All in all, we would say it took us about a year to complete.\u201d\\n\u201cWe were surprised (and happy, of course) when we learned our model would be the latest one in the\\nLEGO Ideas series. What we like about the LEGO Ideas platform is the feedback and support you get\\nfrom the community. It\u2019s great to reply to comments, read suggestions and improve your model in the\\nupdates. Of course, the chance of designing your own LEGO set is also really cool!\u201d\\nLEGO\u00ae designers\\nMichael Psiaki, Carl Thomas Merriam and Austin William Carlson are all full-time LEGO\u00ae designers and\\navid space enthusiasts, so this was a project they very much wanted to be a part of. As Michael explains:\\n\u201cWe were actually not asked. I was so excited when I heard that the project was potentially going to\\nhappen, and told Carl about it because I knew he was also a space fanatic. We decided it would be really\\ncool to work together since it is such a big model, so we approached the Ideas team about helping to\\ndevelop the product.\u201d\\n\u201cWe were amazed by how big the actual model was and how it was able to separate into all of the\\ndifferent stages and components. This was very difficult to implement in our final design, since we needed\\nto make sure that the rocket was strong enough when connected together, but also easy to separate.\u201d\\nBox description:\\nThe front of the box shows the NASA Apollo Saturn V rocket flying in low earth orbit, flames coming out of\\nthe engines of the first stage. In the background you can see a part of the earth covered by clouds, a\\nwaxing gibbous moon, and a starry sky. There is a small inset image of the lunar lander on the moon\u2019s\\nsurface with two astronaut microfigures and the American flag standing next to it. There also is the\\nProject Apollo insignia printed onto the box which is a disk circumscribed by a band showing the words\\n\u201cApollo\u201d and \u201cNASA\u201d. At the center of the disk is a large letter \u201cA\u201d with the earth to its right and the moon\\nto its left, connected by a double trajectory. The moon displays the face of the mythical god Apollo. At the\\nbottom right, there is the LEGO Ideas batch, indicating that this is set #017. Above is a blueprint of the\\nrocket, indicating the model\u2019s height of 100 cm (39.37 in) and diameter of 17.9 cm (7.05 in), comparing it\\nto the size of a LEGO microfigure which is about half the height of the first stage engines. The blueprint\\nalso shows the lunar lander model\u2019s height of 5.3 cm (2.09 in) and diameter of 6.3 cm (2.48 in) as well as\\nthe lunar orbiter model\u2019s height of 3.8 cm (1.5 in) and diameter of 6.4 cm (2.52 in).\\nThe right side of the back of the box shows the rocket divided into its individual components. From bottom\\nto top those are: S-IC First Stage, S-II Second Stage, S-IVB Third Stage, Lunar Module, Service Module,\\nCommand Module, and Launch Escape System (LES).\\nThe left side of the back of the box shows a pictured timeline of the LEGO model from liftoff on earth until\\ntouchdown on the moon. Starting at liftoff, the rocket is complete. The next image shows the rocket\\nwithout the first stage and without the launch escape system. Next, the second stage has fallen away,\\ntoo. The fourth picture shows the Apollo command and service module (CSM) separated from the third\\nstage and lunar module, starting to perform the transposition and docking maneuver. In the next picture,\\nthis maneuver is completed with the CSM having turned around fully and having docked its nose to the\\nlunar module. Afterwards, the CSM pulls the combined spacecraft away from the third stage. The final two\\npictures show the lunar module on its own as well as landed on the moon.\\nThe timeline is enriched with real photos from the time. One photo shows the earth with the Americas in\\nview and points out the location of the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Another photo\\nshows the Apollo Saturn V on the verge of breaking the sound barrier in the background, with an\\nAmerican flag in focus. The next photo shows the lunar module in lunar orbit with the surface of the moon\\ntaking up most of the frame and the small earth rising in the background. There also is a photo of an\\nastronaut\\'s footprint on the surface of the moon. One photo shows the lunar module having landed on the\\nmoon with an American flag and other technical devices standing next to it. A photo of the moon indicates\\nthe landing sites of the different Apollo missions that landed on the moon, namely Apollo 11, 12, 14, 15,\\n16, and 17. The final picture shows the lunar orbiter at splashdown, after having landed back on earth in\\nthe ocean, with an orange dinghy with four men in black diving suits next to it.\\nThe build is 1969 pieces and 337 building steps.']"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['Building Instructions:\\nThe first six large bags deal with the first stage of the rocket.\\nStart by using the parts from the first large bag to build the inner structure of the first stage.\\nOpen the large bag 1.\\nOpen group 1.\\n1.

Locate four black 8l axles (the length of a 1x8 plate) and one yellow 7l axle. Tilt the main rocket onto\\nits side so that the top of the rocket points to the back and its underside points to the front. The pairs of\\n2x6 wedges which are attached to each of the four sides of the rocket at the bottom should be at the top,\\nright, bottom, and left. In this and the next steps you\u2019ll work on the underside of the rocket. Insert the\\nyellow 7l axle from the front into the center hole of the underside of the rocket which is in the center of a\\nlight bluish gray 4x4 round brick. Insert a black 8l axle into the axle hole of the red 1x2 brick at the top\\n(with the cross-shaped - not the round hole!). Repeat on the right, bottom, and left. These are the axles to\\nwhich the 5 engines of the first stage will be attached.\\n121. Locate a dark bluish gray 2x2 round brick with an axle hole and put it onto the yellow axle in the\\ncenter, studs to the back. Move it back as far as possible so that its studs attach to the 4x4 round brick\\nbehind. Locate four light bluish gray technic cranks (they have length 3 and an axle hole on one side as\\nwell as a 1l technic connector on the other side). Orient one of the cranks so that the axle hole is at the\\ntop, aligned to the back and front, and the technic connector is at the bottom, pointing to the back. Like\\nthis, put the top axle hole onto the black 8l axle at the top and move it as far back as possible - the\\ntechnic connector should fit right into the hole of a light bluish gray 1x2 brick. Repeat symmetrically on the\\nright, bottom, and left.\\n122. Make a piece by placing two light bluish gray 2x2 round plates on top of each other and place these\\nonto a dark bluish gray 3x3x2 cone with 2x2 studs on top. Put the piece you just built onto the yellow axle\\nin the center, studs to the back. Move it back as far as possible so that its studs attach to the 2x2 round\\nbrick behind, from the previous step.\\n123. Make a piece four times. Locate a dark bluish gray 3x3x2 cone with 2x2 studs on top. Place a black\\n2x2 brick with an axle hole from top to bottom and a 1-finger hinge connector at one side on top of it,\\nhinge to the left. Connect a pearl dark gray bull bar with a 2-finger hinge connector (LEGO refers to it as a\\ntrain pantograph) horizontally from the left to the hinge connector of the previous piece by clipping the 1-\\nfinger hinge in between the 2-finger hinge. Repeat to make four pieces. Orient one of the pieces you just\\nbuilt so that the top studs point to the back and the bull bar is at the bottom. Like this, put the piece onto\\nthe black 8l axle at the top and move it as far back as possible - the axle should go through the axle hole\\nof the 2x2 brick as well as the axle hole of the 3x3x2 cone. Repeat symmetrically on the right, bottom,\\nand left.\\nOpen group 24.\\n124. Make a piece five times. Locate a pearl dark gray 2x2 plate with an octagonal bar frame around it.\\nClip a pearl dark gray mechanical arm piece from the top to the diagonal bar at the front right of the\\nprevious piece, arm extending to the front right and slightly up. Locate a black 1x1 round tile with a thin\\nbar on top. Insert the thin bar into the hole of the previous piece that\u2019s furthest away from the clip, so\\nwhere a theoretical elbow joint of the mechanical arm would be. Locate a dark bluish gray megaphone\\nand place the stud that\u2019s opposite of its cone-shaped opening onto the previous piece. The opening of the\\nmegaphone should point away from the mechanical arm, the handle should point to the front left. Repeat\\nto make five pieces. Take one of the pieces you just built and change the orientation of the mechanical\\narm and everything that\u2019s attached to it by rotating it at the clip, so that the studs of the 2x2 plate with the\\nbar frame point to the front, the megaphone opening points to the back, and the clip is at the bottom right.\\nLike this, put the piece onto the black 8l axle at the top and move it as far back as possible - the axle\\nshould go through the axle hole in the center of the 2x2 plate with the bar frame. If the plate doesn\u2019t fit\\nonto the axle in the desired orientation, switch the clip to an adjacent bar of the octagonal bar frame and\\nrepeat. The megaphone should then be partially framed by the bull bar. Repeat symmetrically on the\\nright, bottom, and left. Also repeat in the center with the yellow 7l axle, the orientation being the same as\\nfor the piece at the top, clip at the bottom right.\\n125. Make a piece five times. Place a white 2x2 round tile with one stud on top on top of a white 2x2\\nround plate. Place a trans-orange (transparent orange) 3x3 dish with one stud on top onto the previous\\npiece. Place the piece you just built into a pearl dark gray half-high barrel with 2x2 studs and an axle hole\\ninside. Repeat to make five pieces. These are the tail ends of the engines of the first stage. Orient one of\\nthe pieces you just built so that the top stud points to the front. Like this, put the piece onto the black 8l\\naxle at the top and move it as far back as possible - the axle should go through the axle hole of the barrel\\nand the barrel should attach to the pearl dark gray 2x2 plate with an octagonal bar frame from the\\nprevious step. Repeat on the right, bottom, left, and center.\\nOpen group 25.\\n126. Make a piece four times. Locate a dark bluish gray 1x2 plate with a 2-finger hinge connector on one\\nend and orient it horizontally, hinge to the left. Place the upper end of a light bluish gray 1x3x2 curved\\narch vertically onto the left stud of the previous piece, the base of the arch overhanging to the front.\\nRepeat to the right. Place a light bluish gray 1x2 tile horizontally onto the top studs of the two arches.\\nRepeat to make four pieces. Before attaching the pieces you just built to the rocket, identify the\\nattachment point. The attachment point for the top engine is the 1-finger hinge connector right of the red\\n1x2 brick with the cross-shaped axle hole into which you inserted the black 8l axle in step 120. Orient one\\nof the pieces you just built so that the hinge points to the left and the former top of the piece points to the\\nback. Like this, attach the 2-finger hinge connector to the 1-finger hinge connector you identified, before,\\nby clipping the 1-finger hinge in between the 2-finger hinge. Repeat symmetrically on the right, bottom,\\nand left.\\n127. In this step you\u2019ll build the same pieces as in the step before, but mirrored horizontally. Make a piece\\nfour times. Locate a dark bluish gray 1x2 plate with a 2-finger hinge connector on one end and orient it\\nhorizontally, hinge to the right! Place the upper end of a light bluish gray 1x3x2 curved arch vertically onto\\nthe left stud of the previous piece, the base of the arch overhanging to the front. Repeat to the right. Place\\na light bluish gray 1x2 tile horizontally onto the top studs of the two arches. Repeat to make four pieces.\\nThis time, the attachment point for the top engine is the 1-finger hinge connector left! of the red 1x2 brick\\nwith the cross-shaped axle hole into which you inserted the black 8l axle in step 120, so also left of the\\nattachment point from the previous step. Orient one of the pieces you just built so that the hinge points to\\nthe right and the former top of the piece points to the back. Like this, attach the 2-finger hinge connector\\nto the 1-finger hinge connector you identified, before, by clipping the 1-finger hinge in between the 2-\\nfinger hinge. Repeat symmetrically on the right, bottom, and left.\\n128. In this step you will rotate the pieces you attached in the last two steps to form the shell for the outer\\nengines. Start with the top engine and rotate the left and right piece at the respective hinge towards the\\nengine (so towards the front and towards each other) until the two meet in the middle (the bases of the\\narches should touch, flush with each other). Repeat on the right, bottom, and left.\\nSet the current piece aside. Steps 129-132 need to be repeated four times!\\nOpen group 26.\\n129. Locate a black 1x2 slope plate (1x1 slope with a 1x1 plate next to it) from a separate subgroup of\\ngroup 26 and orient it horizontally, slope to the left. Place a blue 1x2 plate horizontally onto the stud of the\\nprevious piece, overhanging to the right.\\n130. Locate a white 1x2 slope plate (1x1 slope with a 1x1 plate next to it) and orient it horizontally, slope\\nto the right. Place its stud under! the right stud of the blue 1x2 plate from the previous step, so that it\\nprotrudes to the right.\\n131. Locate a black 2x2 plate from a separate subgroup of group 26 and place its back row under! the\\nblack 1x2 slope plate from step 129, flush at the left. Locate a white 2x2 plate and place it to the right of\\nthe previous piece, so with its back row under! the white 1x2 slope plate from the previous step, flush at\\nthe right.\\n132. Locate a black 1x2 slope brick! from a separate subgroup of group 26 and place it horizontally, slope\\nto the left, onto the leftmost two studs of the front row. Locate a white 1x2 slope brick! and place it\\nhorizontally, slope to the right, to the right, so onto the rightmost two studs of the front row.\\nMake sure that you repeated steps 129-132 four times. Next you will attach these four pieces to the\\nrocket.\\nStand the rocket upright, so that the engines are at the bottom and one of the outer engines is at the\\nfront.\\n133. Orient one of the pieces you just built so that its top studs point to the front, the black pieces (former\\nleft) are at the left and the white pieces (former right) are at the right. Like this, attach the piece above the\\nengine shell of the front engine that you rotated into place in step 128. The piece will overlay the two\\nhinges you attached the engine shell to in steps 126 and 127, the two studs in between as well as the row\\nof four studs above. Repeat symmetrically on the left, back, and right.\\nOpen group 27.\\n134. Locate a white tail fin and orient it so that its underside points to the back and the fin extends to the\\nfront and bottom. The upper row of 1x2 studs of the piece you attached in the front in the previous step\\nforms a 2x3 plane surface with the 2x2 studs above. Attach the tail fin to this 2x3 surface, oriented as\\ndescribed before. Repeat symmetrically on the left, back, and right.\\n135. Make a piece four times. Orient a light bluish gray 2x4 brick horizontally. Locate a white 2x2 curved\\nslope and place it onto the leftmost two studs of the back row, slope to the back, overhanging to the back.\\nRepeat to the right. Repeat symmetrically in the front row using two black 2x2 curved slopes from a\\nseparate subgroup of group 27. Repeat to make four pieces. Orient one of the pieces you just built so that\\nits underside points to the back, the white pieces (former back) are at the left and the black pieces (former\\nfront) are at the right. Like this, attach the piece in the front right in the open space between the front and\\nright tail fins you attached in the previous step. The top two rows of anti-studs of the piece should attach\\nto a light bluish gray bracket piece further inside the rocket - there should not be a gap between the top of\\nthe piece and the hull of the first stage above. Repeat symmetrically on the front left, back left, and back\\nright.\\nYou have successfully built the engines of the first stage and finished the sixth large bag.\\nContinue by using the parts from the seventh large bag to build the inner structure of the second stage.\\nOpen the large bag 7.\\nOpen group 28.\\nSet the current piece aside.\\n136. Locate a light bluish gray 2x6 plate and orient it horizontally. Place a tan 4x8 half round plate\\nhorizontally, flat side to the front, centered onto the back row of the previous piece, overhanging three\\nstuds to the back and one stud to the left and right, respectively.\\n137. Place a tan 4x8 half round plate horizontally, flat side to the back, in front of the previous piece,\\nforming a circle.\\n138. Flip the piece upside down, vertically, so that the 2x6 plate from step 136 is still oriented horizontally.\\nPlace a reddish brown 2x2 plate upside down and horizontally centered to the back of the 2x6 plate from\\nstep 136. Repeat symmetrically on the front. The two 2x2 plates should form a symmetrical plus sign\\ntogether with the 2x6 plate.\\n139. Locate eight white 2x2 plates with 1x2 side studs. Orient one of them upside down, side studs to the\\nfront and place it so its back right stud is on the front left stud of the previous piece. The front row of the\\nplate should connect to the 4x8 half round plate underneath and the back left stud should be\\nunconnected. Repeat to the right. Repeat what you did with the previous two pieces symmetrically at the\\nleft, back, and right using up all eight plates.\\n140. Flip the piece right side up again.

There are four gaps, one at\\nthe front, left, back, and right, each of them separated by two vertical upright white 1x2 grille tiles. In the\\ncenter of each gap there is a tan 2x2 plate of studs pointing outwards. In this step, you\u2019re going to fill in\\nthe gaps to the right of the mentioned 2x2 plate. In these gaps, towards the inside and left, there is a\\nhorizontal clip further inside the rocket which is what the bar handle of the pieces you just built will be\\nattached to (you won\u2019t be able to feel the clip unless you have very small fingers, but it is there).

Locate a black 3x3x2 cone and orient it upright, tip to the back. Like this, slide it onto the tan axle\\nfrom the previous step until it touches the center stop.\\nSet the current piece aside. Steps 300-301 need to be repeated two times!\\n300. Locate a white 4x8x6 cone half and orient it horizontally, open half to the back.\\n301. Make a piece two times. Locate three white 4x4 round corners with three studs on top and stack\\nthem on top of each other, oriented similarly. Repeat to make two pieces. Orient one of the pieces as if it\\nwere the front left quarter of a circle and place it under! the left half of the cone from the previous step.\\nThe curvature of the round corners should match the one of the cone. Repeat symmetrically to the right.\\nMake sure that you repeated steps 300-301 two times. Next you will attach these two pieces to the ascent\\nstage.\\n302. Flip the ascent stage (the piece you were building before, including the tip of the rocket) right side up\\nagain, the tip of the rocket pointing to the top. Notice that if you place the two half cone pieces you just\\nbuilt next to each other to form a full cone, there is a small hole in the center of the top. This is the hole,\\nthe center stop of the tan 4l axle from step 298 will go through. The top side of the half cones will attach\\nto the underside of the light bluish gray 4x4 round plate almost at the bottom of the ascent stage and the\\nblack 3x3x2 cone at the very bottom of the ascent stage (from step 299) will become hidden inside the\\nhalf cones. Attach the two pieces you just built as described, one from the left and one from the right.\\n303. In this step you will attach the ascent stage and the tip of the rocket you just built to the first three\\nstages you built before. To do so, simply attach the ascent stage from the top to the top of the third stage,\\nrotating the ascent stage until the studs attach. The exact rotation is not important.\\nCongratulations, you have finished building the actual rocket and will continue to build the lunar lander,\\nthe lunar orbiter as well as three stands to display the rocket sideways.\\nSet the current piece aside.

Place a transparent blue 1x2 plate vertically to the right of the indent in the black vehicle base. There\\nshould be three studs between it and the right end of the car.\\n7. Next, collect the steering wheel piece and orient it with the wheel facing left and connect it to the right\\nend of the indented area of the vehicle base. Then place a tan 1x2 sloped tile vertically to the left end of\\nthe indented area with the slope facing right. The 2x2 studded area between these parts will act as the\\ndriver\u2019s seat. Soon, you will add more tan parts to create a luxurious leather interior.\\n8. Locate two tan 1x12 plates and orient them horizontally. Place them either side of the recessed area so\\nthat they run the length of the vehicle.\\n9. Take two black 1x2 plates and orient them horizontally. Connect them symmetrically to the studs to the\\nleft of the technic brick\u2019s axle holes.\\n10. Find another two black 1x2 plates and this time orient them vertically. Connect them to the right studs\\nof the pieces from the previous step so that they connect to the 1x12 plates. The pieces should not\\noverhang the sides of the car. Then, locate a transparent blue 2x2 brick and place it one stud in from the\\nright horizontally and in the middle vertically.\\n11. Collect two yellow 1x2 bricks and place them horizontally on either side of the brick and one stud to\\nthe right.\\n12. Next, take two turquoise 1x1 bricks and place them to the immediate left of the yellow bricks.\\n13. Place a tan 1x6 brick vertically to the left of the 1x1 bricks so that it spans the width of the vehicle.\\n14. Locate the red right wedge plate and orient it horizontally so that the narrow end of the wedge is to\\nthe right. Connect it to the 1x3 of empty studs at the front and in the middle of the model so that the\\nwedge plate overhangs to the left by one stud. Then take the red left wedge plate and place it\\nsymmetrically on the back of the model.\\nNow we can construct the rear of the car! We will build it as a separate part, so set aside what you\u2019ve built\\nso far.\\n15. To start, take the black 4x6 plate and orient it horizontally.\\n16. Find four dark tan corner plates. Orient the first with the outside corner in the top right \u2013 the studs\\nshould form the Braille lowercase letter D \u2013 and connect it to the front right of the 4x6 plate so that the\\nfront stud of the corner plate overhangs in front of the larger plate by one stud. Orient the second corner\\nplate with the outside corner in the top left corner \u2013 the studs should form the Braille lowercase letter F \u2013\\nand connect it to the immediate left of the previous piece, with the front stud overhanging to the front\\nagain. The remaining two corner plates should be placed symmetrically along the back of the plate.\\n17. Locate two black 2x2 modified tiles with two studs. Place the first in the front left corner of the 4x6\\nplate so that the studs align with the 1x4 of studs formed by the corner plates and allow the smooth area\\nof the piece to overhang to the front. Connect the other modified tile symmetrically to the back of the\\nassembly. Take a yellow 2x2 plate and place it between the previous parts, one stud in from the left edge.\\n18. Flip the assembly upside down so that the studs face down and the black 2x2 modified tiles are still\\non the left. Locate the 2x2 inverted tile and orient it with the studs facing down. Connect it to the assembly\\nin the middle of the 4x6 plate along the left edge. Return the assembly to its original orientation by flipping\\nit again, keeping the modified tiles on the left.\\n19. Take a 2x6 technic brick with axle holes and orient it vertically. Connect the assembly on top of the\\npiece so that the raised areas at the ends of the technic brick slot into the gaps between the corner\\nplates.\\n20. Find a black 1x2 plate with 1x4 side studs and orient it vertically. Connect it to the left end of the\\nassembly to the left of the yellow 2x2 plate.\\n21. Collect the light grey 2x2 hinge plate with top bump and orient it with the 1x2 studs vertical and to the\\nright. Connect the hinge plate on top of the 1x2 plate with 1x4 side studs from the previous step. Then,\\nplace a dark grey 1x6 plate vertically to the right of the previous piece.\\n22. Finish the subassembly by finding a light grey hinge cylinder with two fingers and connecting it to the\\ntop bump of the 2x2 hinge plate from the previous step. Once connected, hinge the piece to the left until\\nthe axle hole points horizontally to the left.\\n23. Congratulations, we have now finished building the rear section of the sportscar! We can now join it to\\nthe main body of the vehicle. Align the left end of the main build with the subassembly so that the\\nrightmost front and back studs of the subassembly are touching the red wedge plates on the front and\\nback of the main build. The left ends of the tan plates and black vehicle base should fit in the space\\nbetween the technic cross axle holes. Press on the chassis and the tan plates to connect the parts.\\n24.Take two red 1x3 plates and connect them horizontally to the right of the technic brick\u2019s cross axles.\\nThis serves to strengthen the connection between the assemblies.\\n25. Find a tan 2x2 sloped brick and place it to the left of the driver\u2019s area with the slope facing right. The\\nright edge of the slope should be even with the left edge of the 1x2 sloped tile. In the 2x2 area of empty\\nstuds to the left of the sloped brick, place a yellow 2x2 plate.\\n26. Place a tan 2x2 modified tile with two studs on top of the yellow 2x2 plate from the previous step so\\nthat the studs lie against the sloped brick. Then, take a dark tan corner plate and orient it with the outside\\ncorner in the top right so that it forms the braille letter D. Place it to the left of the modified tile from the\\nprevious step, leaving one stud free in front of the plate. Collect a second dark tan corner plate and\\nconnect it symmetrically. Locate two transparent light blue round 1x1 plates with holes and connect them\\nto the empty studs in front of and behind the corner plates.\\n27. Locate two black 2x3 plates and connect them horizontally to the right of the pieces from the previous\\nstep. The plates should not overhang the sides of the model. Take two tan 2x2 modified tiles with two\\nstuds and place them to the right of the previous parts with the studs horizontal and on the outside of the\\nvehicle.\\n28. Take two dark tan 1x3 plates and place them horizontally on top of the black 2x3 plates one stud in\\nfrom the outside edge of the car.\\n29. Let\u2019s shift our attention to the driver\u2019s area, where we can start to add some details and build up the\\nsides. Locate two light grey 1x1 plates with 1x2 side studs. Orient the first with the side studs facing you\\nand connect it to the front end of the tan 1x6 brick to the right of the steering wheel. Place the second\\npiece symmetrically.\\n30. Locate two black 1x2 sloped tiles and connect them to the side studs of the previous parts so that the\\nslopes face to the left.\\n31. Locate two tan 1x1 plates with single side stud and two light grey round 1x1 tiles decorated with dials.\\nThe dials look like speedometers, with small lines spaced out in a ring and a red indicator hand. Connect\\neach tile to the side stud of a tan plate. Place the parts symmetrically on the tan 1x6 brick so that they lie\\nbetween the parts from the previous step and have a vertical 1x2 of studs between them.\\n32. Make a part: Locate a tan 1x2 brick with 2x2 side studs and place two black ingot pieces horizontally\\nacross the side studs. Repeat to make a second part. Connect the parts horizontally to the left of the 1x2\\nsloped tiles on the sides of the model so that the black ingot pieces face away from the car.\\n33. Find two tan 1x1 bricks with two vertical side studs and place them to the left of the parts from the\\nprevious step with the side studs facing out.\\n34. Collect two dark tan 1x2 bricks with two side studs and connect them to the left of the previous pieces\\nwith the studs facing out.\\n35. Locate two 2x3 curved slopes with two studs and winged ends. Connect them horizontally to the side\\nstuds on either side of the vehicle with the winged ends to the right.\\nIt\u2019s time for another subassembly. This time, we\u2019ll be building a grill to add to the front of the vehicle!\\n36. Take a red mudguard element and orient it so that it slopes to the right.\\n37. Locate a black 5x2 bracket \u2013 this piece has a 2x2 and a 2x3 studded surface separated by a step.\\nPlace the bracket horizontally on top of the mudguard element so that the lower 2x2 of studs connects to\\nthe 2x2 of studs in the middle of the mudguard element. The rest of the piece should overhang to the left\\nof the mudguard.\\n38. Find a dark grey 1x6 plate and orient it vertically. Connect it to the black bracket\u2019s left lower studs so\\nthe plate overhangs the bracket vertically by two studs on either side. Then, take a black 1x2 plate and\\nplace it vertically to the right of the dark grey plate.\\n39. Get another red mudguard element and connect it above the previous mudguard so it slopes to the\\nright.\\n40. Finish the part by placing a black 2x2 modified tile with two studs in the middle of the second\\nmudguard element so that the studs are vertical and to the right.\\n41. Connect the grille subassembly to the main model by slotting the left end of the subassembly into the\\ngap at the right end of the vehicle and pushing down. There should be no gap between the subassembly\\nand the main model.\\n42. Strengthen the connection between parts with a tan 2x3 plate connected horizontally to the right of\\nthe steering wheel.\\n43. Let\u2019s continue to build up the body of the car. Collect two black wheel arch elements and place them\\nto the right of the black 1x2 sloped tiles on the sides of the model. The axle holes of the technic brick\\nshould lie directly below the middle of the arches.\\n(Note: steps 44 and 45 also cover step 46 in the printed instructions.)\\n44. Let\u2019s build the car\u2019s headlights. Make a part: Take a light grey 1x1 plate with two side studs and orient\\nit with the side studs facing right. Connect a black 1x2 plate to the side studs, covering them. Then locate\\na black 1x1 plate with single side stud and connect it to the plate\u2019s upper stud so that the side stud faces\\nyou. Take a black 1x1 sloped tile and connect it to the previous piece so that the slope faces right. Finally,\\ntake two transparent yellow quarter-circle tiles and connect them to the right-facing studs with the corners\\nof the tiles pointing up and away from you. Connect the part to the stud that lies between the front black\\nwheel arch piece and the red mudguard element. Finish by placing a transparent blue round 1x1 plate\\nwith hole on top of the part.\\n45. Now we will make another part, this one being a mirrored version of the previous part. Take a light\\ngrey 1x1 plate with two side studs and orient it with the side studs facing you. Connect a black 1x2 plate\\nto the side studs so that they are covered. Now locate a black 1x1 plate with single side stud and connect\\nit to the upper side stud of the part so that the piece\u2019s single side stud points to the right. Find a black 1x1\\nsloped tile and connect it to the single side stud so that the slope faces towards you. Lastly, collect two \\ntransparent yellow quarter-circle tiles and connect them both to the studs facing you so that the corners\\nare in the upper-left. Connect the part to the stud that lies between the back black wheel arch and the red\\nmudguard in the middle of the model. Finish by placing a transparent blue round 1x1 plate with hole on\\ntop of the part.\\nThe front bumper now has a lot of character: the headlights resemble the multiple eyes of a spider, and\\nthe grille has sharp overhangs which resemble fangs. This is definitely a spider-car!\\n(Note: we have absorbed step 46 in the printed instructions into steos 44 and 45 above, so the steps in\\nthe printed instructions are now one number ahead of those here \u2013 step 50 in the print instructions is step\\n49 here, etc.)\\n46. Find a red 2x4 right wedge plate and orient it horizontally so that the wedge narrows from left to right.\\nConnect it to the studs above the winged curved slope in front of the driver\u2019s area. Take a left 2x4 wedge\\nand connect it symmetrically to the other side. The pieces should not overhang to the left.\\n47. Next, locate a dark grey 1x2 tile with center stud and connect it vertically to the studs to the right of\\nthe steering wheel. Then find a 2x2 corner tile with 45-degree cut. Orient the piece so the 45-degree cut\\nlies in the top left corner. Connect it below the previous piece so that it touches the right end of the red\\nwedge plate to the left. Take a second corner tile with 45-degree cut and place it symmetrically.\\n48. Take a black 2x6 plate and orient it vertically. Connect it to the right of the tiles placed in the last step.\\nThe plate should lie between the upper studded areas of the wheel arches.\\n49. Locate another corner tile with 45-degree cut and orient it so the cut lies in the lower left. Place it so\\nthat the lower left corner of the 2x6 plate occupies the inside of the corner. The corner plate should\\nconnect to the front wheel arch. Take a second corner tile and place it symmetrically on the far side of the\\ncar.\\n50. Take a black 1x1 tile and connect it immediately to the right of the front right corner of the black 2x6.\\nPlace a second black 1x1 tile symmetrically on the far side. Then find the two black 2x2 pointed curved\\nwedges and orient them horizontally with the tip pointing right. Connect the wedges to the right of the tiles\\nso the outer edges lie parallel with the outside of the car.\\nCongratulations, you have finished the first bag! You\u2019re more than halfway through the build.\\nOpen bag 2.\\nConstruct the Morbius minifigure using the minifigure legs, torso, head, and hair. Assemble the purple vial\\nby collecting a transparent goblet, a transparent purple 1x1 round plate, and a transparent purple 1x1\\nround tile. Insert the bottom of the round plate into the top of the goblet so the stud is facing out, then\\ncover the stud with the round tile. Flip the part upside down and you will have built a vial of mysterious\\nliquid! Repeat the steps to construct another vial, this time using transparent red parts in place of the\\npurple pieces (these parts are in the next group of bricks). Clip the vials into Morbius\u2019 hands. Finish by\\ncollecting a pair of bats to serve as his accomplices as he carries out his criminal schemes.\\nMorbius wears a black outfit with a red sash around his waist. His shirt is open, revealing his pale white\\nskin. His face is deeply lined, suggesting great age, and his eyes are bright red. The vampire has two\\nexpressions: an evil smirk, and a monstrous howl.\\nWe can now return to building Miles Morales\u2019 car:\\n51. Let\u2019s finish the hood of the sportscar. Locate a red curved wedge with cutout \u2013 this piece has two\\nsmooth curved sections which lie either side of a 1x2 studded area. Orient the piece with the 1x2 studded\\nregion vertical and to the left. Place the piece in the recessed area at the right end of the vehicle.\\n52. Next, take the black 2x4 curved slope piece with Spiderman logo and orient it so the slope curves\\ndown to the right. This piece is decorated with Spiderman\u2019s iconic symbol, a red spider on a silver web in\\nfront of a black background. Place the slope on top of the previous piece with no overhang to the right.\\nThe leftmost part of the piece should connect to the 2x6 plate to the left of the curved wedge with cutout.\\nLocate two red triangular tiles and connect them either side of the slope with the angled edges slanting\\ninwards from left to right. There should be a vertical 1x6 studded area to the left once the tiles are placed.\\n53. Take another pair of red triangular tiles and place them to the left of the previous pieces with the\\nangled edges again sloping inward from left to right. Each pair of triangles should form a rhombus. Place\\na black 1x2 grille tile to the immediate left of the 2x4 curved slope with Spiderman logo. You have finished\\nbuilding the hood of the car!\\n54. Let\u2019s turn our attention to the rear of the vehicle. Locate two red wheel arches and place them to the\\nleft of the red 2x4 wedge plates that sit on either side of the driver\u2019s seat.\\n55. In the middle of each wheel arch is a 2x2 studded area. One stud to the right and in from the vehicle\u2019s\\nsides, there should be a vertical 1x6 space. Place a tan 1x6 brick in this space.\\n56. Take two red 1x1 tiles and place them on the studs directly behind and in front of the 1x6 brick from\\nthe previous step.\\n57. Place a grey 1x2 brick horizontally behind the front wheel arch and another in front of the back wheel\\narch.\\n58. Next, locate a black 1x6 plate and place it vertically between the red 1x1 tiles so that it covers the tan\\n1x6 brick. Then take two black 1x2 plates and connect them vertically to the immediate left of the 1x6\\nplate, leaving a 1x2 space between them.\\n59. Collect four black 1x2 slopes with stud cutout \u2013 these pieces have a 45-degree slope with a single\\nstud behind the slope. Place one slope vertically on top of the 1x2 plate from the previous step so that the\\nslope faces out from the car, then place a second slope to its immediate right in the same configuration.\\nConnect the other two slopes similarly on the opposite side of the model.\\n60. Take two black grille tiles and connect them across the studs of each pair of slopes. In the space\\nbetween the two rightmost slopes, place a red 1x2x1 bar tile so that the bar is slightly to the right.\\n61. We will now build some accessories to store in the car\u2019s trunk. Take a grey tap piece and connect it to\\nthe stud on top of a yellow 1x1 round brick to create a yellow canister. Repeat the previous step, this time\\nusing a teal 1x1 round brick. Connect the canisters to the model by locating the studs to the left and\\nbelow the bar tile and between the grille tiles placed earlier. The canisters may contain fuel, or spray\\npaint, or perhaps they are key to stopping Morbius\u2019 evil plan \u2013 you decide!\\n62. Now we can build the support for the sportscar\u2019s spoiler. Collect two 2x4 Technic L-beams, which feel\\nlike a print letter L. Orient them with the long sides horizontal and the outside corner of each L in the lower\\nleft. Connect the L-beams with a black Technic pin inserted into the corner of the L-beams. You should\\nnow have a double-thick L-beam. Next, find two blue Technic 1-long axle with pin pieces \u2013 these parts\\nhave a one-stud long axle at one end and a Technic pin at the other. Insert them into the axle holes at the\\nright end of each L-beam so that the pins jut out to either side. Finally, take two 1x1 Technic bricks with\\npinholes and connect them to the pin ends of the previous pieces. Orient the Technic bricks so that the\\nstuds face up. Join the part to the main model by connecting the technic bricks between the wheel arches\\nto the left of the trunk. We will return to finish the spoiler soon.\\n63. Locate two black 1x2 bricks with 2x2 side studs and connect them to the horizontal 1x2 of studs to the\\nleft of the Technic bricks with pinholes from the previous step so that the side studs face away from the\\nvehicle.\\n64. Make two identical parts: stack a light yellow, a transparent orange, and a transparent red 1x2 plate\\non top of one another. (These parts are organised as follows: the two yellow plates are loose in the\\npresent group of bricks, the two orange plates are connected together to form a braille letter D, and the\\ntwo red plates are loose in the next group of bricks.) Then add a red 1x2 sloped tile on top. These parts\\nform the rear lights of the car. Connect them vertically to the right pair of side studs on the previous\\npieces so that the slopes face left.\\n65. Take two red 1x2x1 bar tiles and connect each to the empty side studs so that the bars are slightly to\\nthe right. The bar tiles frame the rear lights, making them appear recessed into the car.\\n66. Find two red 3x3 quarter-circle plates and connect them on either side of the Technic beams with the\\nrounded edges on the outside. The studded surfaces in this area should now all be at the same height.\\n67. Locate a black 2x4 left wedge sloped wedge brick \u2013 this piece has three sloping faces and one stud at\\nthe top. Oriented the piece horizontally with the stud in the back right corner \u2013 the wedge should narrow\\nto the left. Place the wedge brick in front of the Technic beams. The stud on top of the brick should lie to\\nthe immediate left of a grille tile. Then take a black 2x4 right sloped wedge brick and place it\\nsymmetrically on the opposite side.\\n68. A superhero\u2019s car has to have defences, and Miles Morales sportscar is no different! Let\u2019s build a pair\\nof stud shooters. Locate a silver-grey stud shooter element and a dark grey trigger piece \u2013 the shooter\\nelement is three studs long with a stud at one end, and the trigger piece is very small and has no studs or\\nbars. Orient the shooter element horizontally with the stud to the left. Orient the trigger piece horizontally\\nwith the thicker end to the left and the circular part below the elbow. Insert the trigger into the gap in the\\ntop of the shooter element and push down until you feel it click into place. Place a transparent light blue\\n1x1 plate on the stud. Finally, take a dark grey 1x2 45-degree slope with cutout and no stud and orient it\\nhorizontally with the slope facing right and connect it to the part. Add the stud shooter to the vehicle by\\nconnecting it to the horizontal 1x3 of studs directly above the left wheel arch so that the slope is on the\\nleft. There should be one empty stud to the left of the slope. Repeat the preceding steps to create a\\nsecond stud shooter and attach it symmetrically to the opposite side of the vehicle.\\nThe stud shooters accept 1x1 round plates with holes, and four transparent blue 1x1 round plates with\\nholes are included as ammunition. The launchers can send the projectiles quite far, so be careful when\\nusing the stud shooters \u2013 not only is it possible to hurt someone with them, but it is also possible to lose\\nyour pieces!\\n69. Now we will focus on the car\u2019s exhaust. Rotate the car ninety degrees about its vertical axis so that\\nthe stud shooters are pointing away from you. In the lower center of the car, below the Technic beams, is\\na horizontal 1x4 of side studs. Connect a black 1x2 grille tile to the middle two studs. Take four light grey\\n1x1 round plates with holes and stack them in pairs to make two parts, then connect them to the studs on\\neither side of the grille tile.\\n70. Next, find two transparent light blue long and narrow web effect parts with bars on each end and\\ninsert the bars into the stacked 1x1 plates with holes.\\n71. Finally, take the large transparent light blue sword and orient it horizontally with the axle connector to\\nthe right and the jagged edge pointing upward. Insert the axle into the axle hole directly above the grille\\ntile. The car now looks as if it is spitting electric-blue fire from its exhaust.\\n72. We can finally finish the spoiler! Make two identical parts: insert a black Technic pin into the pinhole of\\na black 2x2 plate with pinhole and orient it horizontally with the pin protruding to the right. Take two red\\n1x2 slopes with cutout and no stud and attach them horizontally to the left column of studs on the black\\nplate. Once you have built the parts, connect them to the model by inserting them into the exposed\\npinholes of the Technic beams. You may need to swing the technic beams up a little to be able to do this. \\n73. Complete the spoiler by bridging the gap between the parts with a red 2x4 tile. The spoiler can be\\nraised and lowered or tilted.\\n74. Rotate the car ninety degrees about its vertical axis so that the spoiler and exhaust are to the right.\\nLocate a red 3x4 stepped wedge with no studs \u2013 this piece is smooth with three curved steps. Orient the\\npiece so that the steps go down from left to right. Place the part above the trunk, to the left of the spoiler,\\nso that it aligns with the bar tile. Note that this piece is only loosely connected by the studs on top of the\\ntwo black wedge slopes, meaning it can be easily removed to allow access to the trunk.\\n75. Collect the transparent red windscreen element and orient it horizontally so that the 1x2 of studs is\\noriented vertically to the right. Place the windscreen so that it lies to the immediate left of the stepped\\nwedge. The windscreen\u2019s front should connect to the single center stud to the right of the grille plate at\\nthe right of the hood. The windscreen is connected loosely so it is easy to remove and replace.\\n76. Finish the car by adding the wheels: take four tan 1-long axle with pin pieces and insert the axle ends\\ninto the axle holes under the wheel arches. Assemble the wheels by inserting the wheel rims into the\\ntires. Each wheel rim has a stud on one side and a pinhole on the other \u2013 the pinhole is larger than the\\nstud\u2019s hole. Connect the wheels to the vehicle by pushing the wheels onto the pins under the wheel\\narches.\\nCongratulations, you have finished building Miles Morales\u2019 sportscar! Our hero\u2019s transport is a striking\\nvehicle sporting an aggressive front grill and an angular yet aerodynamic body. It is unmatched for speed\\nand power, spitting blue fire from its exhaust as it rips through the streets.\\nThank you so much for building this set!']"}]}

Example: If you place a 2x1 brick with technic connector on the front wall\\nat the right, connector to the front, and then place another such piece symmetrically on the back wall, at\\nthe right, the technic connector of the second piece should point to the back, since it will be placed\\nsymmetrically.\\n- Centered-vertically: even amount of space in front of and behind piece\\n- Centered-horizontally: even amount of space left and right of piece.\\n- Row: studs lined up from left to right.\\n- Column: studs lined up from top to bottom.\\nNote: count columns left to right, rows back to front, and align the back-left corner stud of the piece if we\\nspecify both the row and column. Example: \u201cPlace the 2x2 brick on the plate\u2019s third row, fourth column\u201d\\nmeans to align the back-left corner stud of the 2x2 brick onto the plate\u2019s stud that meets at the third row\\nand fourth column.']"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please provide instructions for a build matching this introduction:\n[\"43220 Peter Pan & Wendy's Storybook Adventure\\nSet adapted by Ann Wei and tested by Natalie Charbonneau\\nEndless stories await Disney and Peter Pan fans aged 5+ in this LEGO\u00ae \u01c0 Disney Peter Pan & Wendy\u2019s\\nStorybook Adventure (43220) set.

But our desire to\\nexplore the universe beyond the realms of earth did not take flight until the 1960s. Following John F.\\nKennedy\u2019s declaration that America would put a man on the Moon (and return him safely to Earth) by\\nthe end of the 1960s, NASA led the way, placing the USA firmly at the forefront of the global race to\\nexplore space. Others may have ventured into the vacuum of space, but it was on the 20th of July 1969,\\nthat a human footprint first made contact with the surface of the Moon. The landing of the Apollo Lunar\\nLander was broadcast live to a global audience. It was a moment that captivated the world and changed\\nspace travel forever. In the visual instructions, there are pictures of President Kennedy\u2019s speech,\\nnewspaper photos of the Saturn V, the command module, liftoff and Earth rise, as seen from the far side\\nof the moon.\\nA Pioneering Vehicle, A Tribute to Creativity and Innovation\\nThe Apollo 11 Lunar Lander \u201cEagle\u201d was an extraordinary vehicle, representing the first crewed vehicle\\nto land anywhere beyond Earth, and the vehicle that brought the first man onto the Moon. But more than\\nthat, the fragile-looking spacecraft represents humankind\u2019s curiosity, ingenuity, technological skill,\\ndetermination and bravery. It illustrates how creative lateral thinking and perseverance can bring\\nimmense advances for the benefit of all mankind.\\nThis LEGO\u00ae Creator Expert tribute to the Apollo 11 Lunar Lander represents something truly\\nastonishing, an authentic human marvel. Even now, over 50 years later and with the many changes we\\nhave experienced in our lifetimes, this vehicle was part of the creative and technological drive to put a \\nhuman past the comfort zone of our atmosphere. The Apollo 11 Lunar Lander allowed us to venture into\\nthe vast unknown of space and touchdown on the Moon, and that is truly astounding.\\nIn the visual instructions, there are pictures of the lunar lander on the moon, test flights, inside the\\ncommand module and the first footprint on the surface of the moon.\\nAbout NASA - The Apollo Program\\nIn 1958, the National Aeronautics and Space Act was passed, expressing that \u201cIt is the policy of the\\nUnited States that activities in space should be devoted to peaceful purposes for the benefit of all\\nmankind.\u201d As a result, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was founded over 60\\nyears ago for the purpose of leading the peaceful exploration of space, making discoveries about the\\nEarth, its solar system, and the universe. Since then, NASA research has not only led to the exploration\\nof space, but it has also made great advances in aviation, helped to develop a commercial space\\nindustry, enriched the US economy and created jobs. It was after a series of earlier Mercury, Gemini\\nand Apollo missions, as well as the work of thousands of expert scientists, engineers and astronauts,\\nthat Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed the Lunar Module on July 20th, 1969 and walked on the\\nMoon. The entire program ran from 1961 to 1972 and set several human spaceflight milestones. Apollo\\n8 was the first manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while the final Apollo 17 mission was\\nthe sixth Moon landing. The program was not only groundbreaking in terms of space exploration, it\\ncatalyzed technological development in avionics, telecommunications and computers. In the visual\\ninstructions, there are pictures of the lunar lander on the moon, test flights, inside the command module\\nand the first footprint on the surface of the moon.\\nWe Came in Peace \u2026 What was Left Behind\\nHumankind\u2019s initial step on the surface of a celestial object was born out of a race to be the first; the\\nMoon landing, made possible by the Lunar Lander, was a huge achievement for American technological\\npride and prowess, as well as a tremendous moment for all humanity. John F. Kennedy\u2019s bold and\\nambitious call to action did not end with the successful Apollo 11 mission; it set off a new era for NASA\\nand for humanity\u2019s exploration of the unknown. NASA\u2019s work today still focuses on technological\\ninnovation and discovery, pushing boundaries toward human exploration of the Moon and Mars, and\\nreaching beyond to find the answer to the question, \u201cAre we alone?\u201d\\nMany things were left on the Moon after that initial landing by the Eagle. Part of the descending rocket\\nfor returning the astronauts back to Earth, as well as the laser reflector and the footprints of the two\\nastronauts remain on the moon. They also left an Apollo 1 mission patch, a memorial bag with a gold\\nreplica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of peace, and a silicon message disk with the\\ngoodwill statements of U.S. presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon, and messages from\\nleaders of 73 countries around the world. Commemorative medallions were also left on the surface of\\nthe Moon, that honor the memories of the Apollo 1 astronauts who lost their lives in a launchpad fire,\\nand two cosmonauts who also died in accidents. In the visual instructions, there is a picture of the\\ncommemorative plaque that had this inscription: \u201cHere men from the planet earth first set foot upon the\\nmoon, July 1969. They came in peace for all mankind\u201d It was signed by the astronauts and President\\nNixon.\\nThe Apollo 11 Mission Key Moments\\nJuly 16, 1969 - Apollo 11, the first manned space flight to land on the Moon, launched into space. There\\nis a picture of liftoff of the Saturn V rocket and the Lunar Lander on board.\\nJuly 17, 1969 - Astronauts Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Edwin \u2018Buzz\u2019 Aldrin made their first TV\\ntransmission to Earth from space. There is a picture of the Lander on the surface of the moon, with an\\nastronaut descending the ladder.\\nJuly 20, 1969 - Armstrong and Aldrin boarded the Lunar Lander \u201cEagle\u201d and disengaged from the\\nApollo Command Module \u201cColumbia.\u201d The Lunar Lander touched down on the Moon in the \u201cSea of\\nTranquility.\u201d The two astronauts spoke to President Richard M. Nixon from the Moon\u2019s surface. They\\nspent 2.5 hours collecting samples, setting up equipment, taking pictures and leaving special items.\\nThere are pictures of the lunar lander as id descended to the surface of the moon, and after it landed,\\nsitting alone on the gray powdery soil. \u201cThe Eagle has landed\u201d!\\nJuly 21, 1969 \u2013 After a rest period for the astronauts, the module ascended and returned to Command\\nModule Columbia and docked, reuniting Armstrong and Aldrin with Collins. The Lunar Lander was then\\njettisoned into lunar orbit. There is a picture of the ascent module flying above the moon, with the earth\\nin the background.\\nJuly 22, 1969 \u2013 On the way back to Earth, a midcourse correction and two more television\\ntransmissions were made. There is a picture of the ground command team at their computer screens.\\nJuly 24, 1969 \u2013 The Apollo 11 capsule and astronauts on board landed back on Earth, splashing down\\ninto the Pacific Ocean. There is a picture of the command module capsule floating in the Pacific Ocean,\\nwith orange floatation collars holding it upright, so the crew could exit safely into a raft, then to travel to\\nan aircraft carrier to take them home.\\nIn the visual instructions, there is another picture of the first footprint on the surface of the moon, with\\nthe quote from Neil Armstrong: \u201cThat\u2019s one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind\u201d.\\nFun Facts\\nFor both the actual Lunar Lander and our LEGO\u00ae tribute, blueprints like these are the beginning of\\nevery design process. There is a picture of the blueprint for the Lunar Lander, and the LEGO designer\\nLars Joe Hylding, Design Manager Specialist. This is how the design of the original module was\\ntranslated into LEGO bricks. The golden bricks represent the foil that the Lunar Lander was wrapped in,\\nfor thermal and micrometeoroid protection. The two main elements of the Lunar Lander are the ascent\\nstage and the descent stage. On the ascent stage, among other things, I focused mostly on the \u201cface\u201d\\nwith the two windows and the door. The ascent stage has a lot of angles that I had to build in a more\\nsimplified way due to the scale. On the descent stage, among other things, I focused on capturing the\\noctagon shape, the legs, and the shiny foil.\\nFun Facts\\n\u2026designed by MIT, the computer on board the Lunar Lander, the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC),\\nprovided the guidance, navigation and control of the spacecraft. The computer\u2019s performance was\\ncomparable to first-generation home computers available in the late 1970s but is similar to a simple\\ncalculator today.']"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "['Assemble the first astronaut minifigure.

Use two black 2x8 plates horizontally, one on the front and one on the back, to connect all the\\nindividual side studs at the bottom of the assembly. Then use four light gray 1x8 tiles horizontally to\\ncover up all the studs of the previous two pieces. The figure should now be secure, and shaped like a\\nbig O.\\n143. Insert a black wrench shaped piece with a clip into a dark gray piece with four bars going in\\ndifferent directions. Use the clip to clip this onto the black horizontal bar on the top left of the assembly.\\nDo the same again but instead of using a dark gray piece with bars going in different directions, use a\\nsilver radar dish piece, and clip it onto the horizontal bar on the top right. \\n144. Make a part: Place two light gray 3x1 upside down tiles under a light gray 1x6 plate. Place this\\nstack vertically inside the O shape, on the left, flush with the front surface. Repeat this step again, but\\nthis time place it on the front right.\\n145. Make a part: Find a light gray 2x2 plate. Then find four light gray 1x2 plates with a sloped end.\\nPlace the four light gray sloped end 1x2 plates under the 2x2, so that two of the sloped ends point to the\\nright, and the other two, to the left. Then cover the 2x2 with a black 2x2 tile. Place this assembly\\nvertically onto the right of the capsule assembly, in the middle and perpendicular to the Side-studded\\nblack 2x4, with the slopes going up and down, with the downward-facing slopes aligned with the bottom\\nof the assembly.\\n146. Find four light gray sloped pyramidal bricks, and place two to the front and two to the back of the\\nprevious piece, flush with the octagonal shape underneath it.\\n147. Rotate the assembly 180 degrees, so that you can repeat step 145, but on the other side of the\\ncapsule. In this step though, before you place the six-piece assembly vertically onto the capsule, place\\ntwo black 2x4 plates horizontally under it first, flush.\\n148. Repeat step 146, but place two light gray 2x2 corner triangular plates under each corner brick,\\nelevating everything by two plates, everything flush just like on the other side, but two plates more out.\\n149. Turn the capsule upside-down so that the clips are at the left and right. Make a part: Find a black\\ncone brick with a 4x4 bottom and 2x2 at the top. Place a black 2x4 plate horizontally onto it with two\\nstuds overhanging on each side. Place this assembly vertically upside down onto the middle of the\\ncapsule, the wide end of the cone pointing up. Then set this assembly aside.\\n150. Find a large light gray 2x8 U shaped brick.\\n151. Place two light gray 2x2 upside down tiles under the U-shaped brick, covering the tubed underside\\nof the brick, making it smooth.\\n152. Make a part: Find a black 2x4 plate and orient it horizontally. Place a light gray 2x2 plate onto the\\n2x4s middle four studs. Then place two light gray 2x2 triangular corner plates, one onto the left end and\\none onto the right end of the 2x4, forming an edge with six studs at the front, and four at the back. Flip\\nthis over 180dg, so that the bottom is facing up and the side with four studs is at the front. Place a light\\ngray 1x2 plate with a ball socket horizontally under the front middle two studs of the black 2x4, socket to\\nthe front. Then place a light gray 1x2 plate horizontally, directly behind the previous piece. Find two\\nblack slope curved 2x2 tiles and place them over the previous two pieces, one sloping to the right and\\none to the left. Then flip it back over, except with the socket pointing back now. Place two light gray 1x1\\nrounded tiles onto the outside back studs of the assembly, with the straight edges pointing to the front\\nand middle, rounded parts to the back left and back right respectively. Then place the large 2x6 clear\\nwindshield piece over the front six studs of the assembly horizontally, windshield slope to the back,\\noverhanging to the front. Then use the front studs of the windshield piece to connect the two assemblies\\nby placing the back studs of the U-shaped piece from the assembly with the U shaped piece under the\\nfront studs of the windshield piece.\\n153. Make a part: Find a light gray 1x2 brick and put it horizontally on the table. Place two black 1x1\\nbricks with side studs onto the brick, so that their side studs pointing to the front and to the sides. Place\\ntwo light gray 1x2 plates, upright, each onto one of the outer side studs of the 1x1s, going down. Place a\\nlight gray 1x2 plate with middle stud horizontally over the two front side studs. Then place two sloped\\nlight gray 1x2 grilled tiles, each onto the two vertical side 1x2 plates, each sloping down. Place this\\nassembly onto the back two studs of the previous assembly so that the plate with middle stud is facing\\nback, and the grilled pieces facing to the left and right, laid over the 1x1 rounded tiles.\\n154. Place two light gray 1x2 bricks vertically, each to the side of the windshield piece, onto the sides of\\nthe U-shaped brick, flush with it. \\n155. Make a part: Find a light gray 1x2 brick and orient it horizontally. Place two black 1x1 plates with\\nside studs going up and in front of them under the 1x2, with the side studs going to the front. Place a\\nblack 1x2 plate with two side studs horizontally onto the 1x2, with the side studs going to the front.\\nThere should now be a 2x2 surface of studs at the front of this part. Place a dark gray 2x2 tile over the\\nfour side studs. Decorate this tile with sticker 1-- it shows a control panel with dials/indicators on it. Place\\nthis assembly onto the front middle two studs of the previous assembly, right in front of the windshield\\nwith the tile facing to the front.\\n156. Place a light gray 1x6 plate horizontally, over the previous assembly forming a 2x8 surface on the\\ntop of the assembly.\\n157. Place two light gray 1x2 bricks with a hinge on the side, each horizontally, on the back row, of the\\n2x8 surface, on the left and right end respectively, with their hinges pointing outward. Then find two light\\ngray 1x1 bricks with a bar on the side and insert the bar into two black 1x1 round plates, one on the top\\nand one on the bottom. The 1x1 round plates should slide on if you insert them on the stud first. Place\\neach 1x1 brick one stud to the front of each of the 1x2s outer stud, with their bars facing forward.\\n158. Place a black 1x4 frame that is three bricks tall horizontally between the 1x2 bricks with the joints.\\nPlace two light gray 1x1 bricks, one to the right and one to the left of the frame, each on one of the 1x2s.\\nPlace two light gray 1x2 bricks, vertically, to the outside of the previous two pieces, and covering\\neverything from the previous layer. Make a part: Find a light gray 2x6 plate and two light gray 1x2 plates.\\nPut the 2x6 plate horizontally on the table and place the 1x2 plates vertically each onto the horizontal\\n2x6\\'s rightmost and leftmost columns. Find two light gray 1x2 sloped bricks that are each two bricks tall.\\nPlace them each onto the previous two previous pieces sloping back. Place this 2x6 assembly centered\\nonto the back two studs of the previous assembly, with the 1x2 sloped bricks right behind the 1x1 bricks.\\n160. Find a 3-brick-tall 1x4 black frame, and insert two dark gray doors into it, closed. Place this frame\\nright to the front of the other frame, with the doors facing to the front.\\n161. Find two black 1x1 plates with a side stud going to the front and up in front of it, and two black and\\nyellow lever pieces. Place each lever onto one of the side studs. Place the 1x1s to the sides of the back\\nframe, one to the left and one to the right, each plate on a 1x1 brick from the previous layer, levers to\\nthe front. Place a black 1x1 round plate onto each of the previous 1x1 plates.\\n162. Find two light gray 1x2 plates with a sloped end. Place them vertically onto each of the previous\\npieces, with their front studs on the previous pieces and with their back stud, the one with the sloped\\nend, placed over the sloped 1x2 brick, sloping to the back.\\n163. Find a large 2x8 U shaped brick, different from the one in step 150, and place it horizontally over\\nthe frames, 1x2 plates, 1x1 round pieces and 1x2 bricks, making the top of this assembly smooth and\\nround.\\n164. Make a part: Find a dark gray 1x2 plate with three cones facing out of it in opposite directions.\\nOrient it so that the cones are facing to the front, to the left and to the back. Place a dark gray 1x2 plate\\nwith a square hinge instead of one of the studs horizontally onto the 1x2 with cones, with the hinge to\\nthe right. Connect a black hinge limb onto the previous piece\\'s hinge and bend it so that it goes\\nupwards. Find a dark gray 1x1 cone and place it under the 1x2 with cones\\' left stud. Make two of these\\nassemblies and connect them to the capsule by snapping the hinged limb onto the hinges on the left\\nand right of the capsule. The cones should face to the back, right, up and down. Rotate the capsule so\\nthat the doors are facing to the back and bend the limbs to the front at about 45 degrees.\\n165. Rotate the assembly 180 degrees so that the top is now at the bottom. Find a silver radar dish\\npiece and a dark gray ball joint pin and insert the pin into the outer side of the radar dish. Connect the\\nradar dish to the assembly using the ball joint pin and the ball joint socket at the front top of the\\nassembly. Point the dish up. You have now completed the reaction control system, or RCS. \\n166. Attach the RCS and the capsule by connecting the 1x1 bricks with bars with the 1x1 round plates to\\nthe yellow 2x1 plates with clips on the front of the capsule.\\nFun Fact: The reaction control system (RCS) provides thrust to a spacecraft, allowing it to be steered in\\nthe right direction. This system was used by the Apollo Lunar Lander when descending to the Moon.\\n167. Set the capsule aside. Make a part: Place two 3x2 under sloped bricks onto the right four studs of a\\nblack 2x4 plate oriented horizontally with their two sloped rows overhanging to the right, one right next to\\nthe other.\\n168. Place a light gray 2x4 brick vertically to the left of the two previous pieces, its left column\\noverhanging to the left. Then place another black 2x4 plate under the previous 2x4 brick vertically, with\\nits left column protruding to the left.\\n169. Take two more light gray 2x3 under sloped bricks and place them right next to each other on the\\nleft column of the previous 2x4 plate, with their two left columns that have a sloped underside sloping to\\nthe left.\\n170. Place a light gray 2x4 brick vertically over the previous two piece\\'s leftmost columns. Do the same\\non the other side with another 2x4. Place a light gray 1x4 brick horizontally in the gap between the 2x4s\\non the front row. Place another one the same way in the gaps back row.\\n171. Place two light gray 1x6 bricks horizontally in the middle of the front and back row of the next layer,\\neach onto one of the 1x4s from the previous step. Place two light gray 1x2 bricks, vertically to the left\\nand to the right of the back 1x6 brick. Place two light gray 1x2 bricks with hinges on their sides\\nhorizontally to the front of the previous pieces and into the middle, with their hinges pointing out, and\\ntheir inside studs to the center of the front 1x6. Place two light gray 1x1 bricks with bars in front of them\\neach to the front of the previous piece\\'s outer studs, completing the outside of the layer. Slide a total of\\nfour black round 1x1 plates onto the bars, two each, similar to step 157.\\n172. Place a light gray 2x4 brick vertically over the previous two piece\\'s leftmost columns. Do the same\\non the other side with another 2x4. Place a tan 1x4 brick with side studs horizontally in the gap between\\nthe 2x4s on the front row. Place another one the same way in the gaps back row.\\n173. Place two light gray 3x4 sloped bricks vertically onto the sides of the layer, with the one on the left\\npointing to the left and with the one on the right pointing to the right, with their three sides flush with the\\nfront back and sides. Then place a light gray 2x4 brick vertically between the two previous pieces,\\ncompleting the layer, flush with the front and back.\\n174. 5 Steps to go! Cover the 4x4 surface of studs at the top of the assembly using a black 2x4 plate\\nplaced horizontally in the front and two black 2x2 tiles placed next to each other in the back.\\n175. Make a part: Find a light gray 2x2 plate. Place a light gray 1x2 plate onto the 2x2\\'s two left studs.\\nThen place a light gray 1x2 plate with a ball socket directly to the right of the other 1x2, socket pointing\\nto the right. Then cover the two 1x2s with a black 2x2 tile. Clip a dark gray ball pin into the ball joint\\nsocket and slide a round piece with 4 bars sticking out of it shaped piece onto it. Angle the pin so that\\nthe 4-bar piece points up. Then connect this mini assembly onto the middle four studs of the 2x4 from\\nthe other assembly, with the 4 bars pointing up and back.\\n176. Place two light gray 2x4 tiles vertically onto the four side studs at the front of the assembly. Place\\neach of them by hanging them down from their top two studs. Then decorate these two tiles with stickers\\n10 and 11, 11 goes on the right and 10 goes on the left. The stickers illustrate control panels that can be\\nopened and handles and connectors.\\n177. Repeat step 164, except bend the limbs towards the back. \\n178. Connect this assembly to the back of the capsule the same way you connected the RCS.\\n179. Connect the capsule to the lander using the clips at the bottom of the capsule and the hinge pieces\\nin the hole in the lander.

Inspired by Avatar: The Way of Water\\nThe set includes 4 Avatar minifigures Neytiri, Kiri, Ronal and Tonowari, three of which are taller than\\nnormal minifigures, proportional to their size in the movies, with unique hair and tails. The minifigures plus\\na toy canoe with oar, torch, double-pronged spear and kitchen utensils. The first minifigure has light blue\\nlegs, tail, torso, and head, with a bumpy black hair piece. The prints on his torso show it wearing some\\nblue tusks tied to a rope wrapping around its chest. The second minifigure is turquoise, with a brown sack\\nprinted onto the torso. The legs also show a brown leather piece of clothing printed on. The third\\nminifigure is also turquoise, with some rocks hanging from its neck printed onto the torso. It is also shown\\nwearing an orange piece of clothing on the legs. The fourth minifigure is more blue, and is shown wearing\\na similar piece of clothing on its legs as the previous one. It is also wearing some orange tusks around its\\nneck.\\nThis set has 528 pieces and 182 steps\\nThe box measures over 12\" (30 cm) high, 22\" (57 cm) wide and 1.5\" (4 cm) deep. It has artwork of the\\nreef home, as well as some of the other assemblies that go with it we will be building, and the scale\\ndrawings of the minifigures.\\nCombine this set with others from the LEGO Avatar range to expand the play possibilities and build your\\nown version of Pandora (sold separately)\\nThe reef home is a structure situated in the water, built by the Na\u2019Vi. In this set, the structure stands on\\ntwo pillars which go all the way down to the bottom of the ocean. The set includes underwater\\ncomponents, such as diverse coral and fish, all assemblies we will be building. A portion of the structure\\nalso extends out further into the water. A turquoise canoe with a Na\u2019Vi rider orbits the home. Several\\nother minifigures are also situated on the structure, cooking with the fire in the middle of the home and the\\ningredients caught from the water.\\nThe front of the box is blue, showing the full Reef Home, and several minifigures living on it, with the blue\\nocean in the background. You can see the additional coral attachment next to the reef home, as an extra\\ndetail. The front of the box also shows the underwater portion of the set, and how all of the creatures\\nliving under the reef home come to life. The bottom corner of the box introduces us to the four minifigures\\nof the set, which are Ronal, Tonowari, Neytiri, and Kiri. On the top of the box it gives us a bigger glance\\ninto the bodies of the four minifigures, as well as a scale drawing to show their true size.\\nThe back of the box shows the entire set from a different angle, showing the minifigures doing different\\ntasks at the home, such as cooking and fishing. The background is colored in a traditional avatar blue\\ncolor, with animal patterns. The top corner of the back of the box shows three zoomed in features of the\\nhome, offering a variety of views of the minifigures with their cooking equipment, a minifigure in the\\ncanoe, and a part of the underwater portion of the set. The sides of the boxes give us more similar angles\\nof the set.']"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[\"Building instructions\\nBag 1, we will be building two minifigures, a boat, and a coral base.\\n1. Assemble the first minifigure by connecting the legs, tail, torso, head, and hair. This minifigure has\\nshorter legs, unlike the others, and a slightly darker blue tail, torso, legs, and head, as well as slightly\\nshorter hair.\\n2. Then connect the tan bar piece with the small flat black oar piece in order to make the oar. The flat oar\\nend piece should connect to the side of the bar with the stop ring, which is the side with the little round\\nbump going around the bar. Then give the oar to the minifigure.\\n3. Assembly the second minifigure by connecting the legs, tail, torso, head, and hair. This minifigure has\\nlonger legs, and a slightly lighter turquoise tail, torso, legs, and head, as well as slightly longer hair.\\n4.

Ron is wearing a dirty red sweater and gray pants. One leg of his pants is\\nwhite, indicating he\u2019s wearing a cast on that leg! Put a brown 3L bar in his right hand and his wand in his\\nleft hand. The 3L bar should extend down to the ground so Ron can use it to help him walk!\\nOpen group 1.\\n1. The lower floor of the hospital wing has three nearly identical rooms with beds. We\u2019ll start building\\nthere. Place a dark tan 8x8 lattice plate in front of you.\\n2.1. Place a tan 2x4 brick, horizontally long and centered horizontally, on the back row of the previous\\npiece, even with the back of the previous piece.\\n2.2. Place a tan 1x2 slope to the left of the previous piece, with the slope at the front. Place another on\\nthe right side of the 2x4.\\n3.1. Now we will assemble two light brown 1x4 hinge bricks. Find a 1x2 brick which has a downwards\\npointing pin on one short end, and a 1x2 brick which has a pin hole at the bottom of one short end. Push\\nthe pin from the first piece into the hole on the second, keeping the studs of both pointed up.You can\\nopen the hinge to create a 1x4 brick, close the hinge to make a 2x2 brick, or make it some angle in\\nbetween. Close the hinge so the hinge brick looks like a 2x2 brick. Note there is a curved bump at the\\nside which hinges. Make another hinge brick.\\n3.2. Place one 1x4 hinge brick, closed up, with the curved bump at the back, to the left of the left 1x2\\nslope. The left half of the hinge brick should overhang to the left of the lattice plate. Place another, in the\\nsame orientation, to the right of the right 1x2 slope.\\n4. Attach a dark tan 8x8 lattice plate under the overhanging part of the left hinge plate, with its front even\\nwith the front of the first lattice plate. Place another symmetrically under the right hinge plate.\\n5. Place a tan 1x2 slope to the left of the left hinge brick, with the slope at the front, and the back even\\nwith the back of the lattice plate. Place another symmetrically to the right of the right hinge plate.\\n6.1. Place a tan 2x4 brick, horizontally long, to the left of the left slope from the previous step. Place\\nanother symmetrically to the right of the right slope from the previous step.\\n6.2. Find two light brown 1x2 masonry bricks. A masonry brick has a brick wall pattern on one side, and\\nhorizontal grooves on the other side. Place one masonry brick, horizontally long, on the back row to the\\nleft of the left 2x4 brick from the previous step. The side with both horizontal and vertical grooves should\\nbe at the back. Place another symmetrically to the right of the rightmost 2x4 brick.\\n6.3. Place a light gray 1x1 brick with a hole on the side, on the leftmost column, in front of the left\\nmasonry brick from the previous piece, with the hole at the left. Place another symmetrically in front of the\\nmasonry brick on the right side.\\n7.1. Place a light brown 1x2 masonry brick, vertically long on the left piece from the previous step,\\nextending back one stud so it is even with the back of the build. The side with both horizontal and vertical\\ngrooves should be at the right. Place another symmetrically on the right piece from the previous step.\\n7.2. Place a tan 1x1 scroll brick to the right of the left previous piece, with the scroll at the back. Scroll\\nbricks are a 1x1 brick with a bar sticking out even with the top on one side, which has a stud on top and a\\ncircular decoration on the sides. Skip four studs to the right and place another scroll brick in the same\\norientation. Skip two more studs and place another scroll brick in the same orientation.

Place one stack, with the studs oriented like a Braille letter J, on the leftmost scroll brick and masonry\\nbrick. The back stud on the stack should attach to the decorated scroll on the scroll brick. Place another\\nstack, with the studs oriented like a Braille letter H, on the next scroll brick to the right. There should be a\\nfour stud gap between this stack and the previous stack. Place another stack, with the studs oriented like\\na Braille letter J, to the right of the previous stack. Repeat these three stacks symmetrically on the right\\nside of the build.\\n9. Place a light brown 1x1 brick in front of the left stud of the leftmost stack from the previous piece. It\\nshould be on top of a masonry brick. Put another 1x1 brick on the first. Repeat these two pieces\\nsymmetrically on the right side of the build. There should be three breaks in the wall which are four studs\\nwide. The windows will go in these gaps!\\nOpen group 3 and group 4. Group 3 contains the window frames for the next step, and group 4 contains\\nthe window lattice.\\n10.1. Assemble a window by attaching a white 1x2x2 lattice into a tan 1x2x2 window frame. Find the lip in\\nthe window frame and rotate the window so that it is at the front, then push a lattice in from the front.\\nRepeat this eighteen times.\\n10.2. Using the windows just created, make six stacks of three windows, keeping all the lattices at the\\nfront.\\n10.3. Place one stack of windows, with the lattice at the back, to the right of the leftmost stack of corner\\nbricks. Place another stack to the right of the first stack. This is the first hospital window! Repeat this in\\nthe other two window gaps. There should be a raised row of four studs in front of each window.\\nOpen group 5.\\n11. Now we\u2019ll start making the hospital beds! First we\u2019ll place the headboards. Place three white 1x4x2\\nfences, horizontally long, one on each set of raised studs in front of the windows. These are shaped kind\\nof like a capital letter D on its side.\\n12. Now to make the beds themselves, there will be three identical beds. Set the hospital wing aside for\\nnow.

Place a white 1x3 jumper plate behind the previous piece. A jumper plate is a 1x2 plate with a single\\nstud on top, or a 1x3 plate with only two studs on top. Place another 1x3 jumper plate on the first. These\\nare the sheets of the bed.\\n14.2. Place a white 1x2 slope tile, horizontally long and centered horizontally, with the thick part at the\\nback, on the previous piece. This is the pillow of the bed!\\n15. Place a light blue 2x4 curved slope with a 1x4 plate on one side, vertically long, in front of the left stud\\nof the previous piece, with the curve on the left. Place another symmetrically to the right of the first. These\\nare the hospital blankets on the bed.\\n16. Place a white 2x2 brick under the front two rows of the previous two pieces.\\n17.1. Place a light blue 2x2 tile in front of the pillow, centered horizontally.\\n17.2. Place a light blue 2x2 tile with two studs on top, in front of the previous piece, with the studs at the\\nfront. It should be even with the front of the bed.\\n17.3. That\u2019s one bed! Now let\u2019s repeat steps 12-17.2 two more times.\\n18. Place a hospital bed, vertically long, with the pillow at the back, in front of each headboard, centered\\nhorizontally on the headboards.\\n19. Make the footboards by placing a white 1x4x2 fence, horizontally long, in front of each bed. These\\npieces should be on the front row of the lattice plates.\\nOpen bag 2.\\nOpen minifigure group 2.\\nAssemble the Madam Pomfrey minifigure by attaching the torso on the skirt leg piece, placing the head\\non the torso, and putting the combined hair and hat piece on the head. Place a tan wand in her right\\nhand.\\nAssemble the medical chart by placing a light gray 1x2 plate with two studs hanging down from one long\\nside, horizontally long in front of you, with the side studs at the left. Then place a black 2x2 tile, with a\\nmedical charts sticker on it, onto the side studs of the previous piece so that it\u2019s even with the top of the\\nprevious piece. Madam Pomfrey can hold the chart by putting the flat part of her hand into one of the antistud on the bottom of the 1x2 plate with side studs.\\nOpen group 6.\\n20.1. Place two tan 1x2x2 tall bricks, horizontally long, in a row on the wall between the left and center\\nwindows. Place two more on the wall between the right and center windows.\\n20.2.

Place a dark tan 1x2 brick with a log pattern, vertically long, on the previous piece.\\n50. Place a tan 1x1x3 tall brick on each of the concave slope bricks. These should be in the back right\\nand front right corners of the build. Set the clock tower aside for the moment.\\nOpen group 13.\\n51. Place a dark tan 1x8 plate, horizontally long, in front of you.\\n52.1. Place a light brown 1x2 plate, horizontally long and centered horizontally, on the previous piece.\\n52.2. Place a dark tan 1x1 plate on the leftmost and rightmost studs of the 1x8 plate.\\n53.1. We\u2019re going to make the mount for the clock now. Place a light brown 1x1 brick on each of the\\npieces from the previous step.\\n53.2. Place a tan 1x2x2 tall brick with four studs on one side to the right of the left piece from the previous\\nstep, with the side studs at the front. Place another symmetrically on the right side of the build. These\\npieces should go directly on the 1x8 plate.\\n53.3. Place a tan 1x2 brick with a pin-hole on the side, horizontally long, between the previous two\\npieces. It should go onto a 1x2 plate. This brick will support the clock!\\n54.1. Place a light brown 1x2 plate, horizontally long, on the previous piece.\\n54.2. Place a dark tan 1x1 plate on the leftmost and another on the rightmost stud of the assembly. The\\ntop of this assembly should be level now.\\n55. Place a dark tan 1x8 plate, horizontally long, on top of the assembly.\\n56.1. Place a sand green 1x2 slope tile, vertically long, on the leftmost column of side studs, with the thick\\nside at the left.\\n56.2. Place a tan 1x2 tile, vertically long, on the side studs to the right of the previous piece.\\n56.3. Repeat steps 56.1-56.2 symmetrically on the right side of the assembly. Rotate the assembly so it is\\nvertically long, and the slope tiles are on the right.\\n57. Place the rest of the clock tower in front of you, with the concave arches on the right. Keeping the\\norientation from the previous step, place the clock mount to the left of the 1x1x3 tall bricks, centered\\nvertically. It should attach to a 1x1 brick at the front and back.\\nOpen group 14. \\n58.1. Now we\u2019ll assemble the face of the clock itself! Place a clear 6x6 dish with a clock pattern on the\\nconcave side in front of you, with the studs up. This piece has a hole through the center, and a 2x2 set of\\nstuds.\\n58.2. Place a tan 1x1 quarter circle tile on the back left stud, with the corner at the back left. Place\\nanother to the right of the first, with the corner in the back right. Repeat these two pieces symmetrically on\\nthe front two studs. The corners should form a square, and there should be a hole in the center.\\n58.3. Rotate the dish so it is upright, with the tiles on the left. The concave side of the dish is marked with\\nroman numerals, I through XII. If you have a helper, they have marked the back side dish with a sticker\\nwhere the XII is so that we can have the clockface oriented correctly! Push a dark tan 3L axle through the\\ncenter hole of the clock face, Push it through from the right, with the stud on the right.\\n58.3. Now we\u2019ll attach the clock face to the clock tower. Orient the tower floor with the wall on your right.\\nFind the hole on the tower support. This hole is centered vertically on the wall. Keeping the tape mark at\\nthe top of the clock face, push the axle from the previous step through the hole in the support. The tiles\\non the left side of the clock face should fit in between the tiles on the right side of the clock tower to\\nprevent the clock from rotating. You might need to rotate the clock face a little bit to get it perfectly\\naligned.\\n58.4. Once the clock face is aligned, push a large light gray 40 tooth gear over the axle from the left. This\\nwill hole the clock face from falling off. Now, pull the tape off of the clock face. Now, when the gear is\\nturned, the axle and stud will turn, but the face of the clock will stay put, since it is held in place by the\\ntiles. This is how we\u2019ll make the arms of the clock turn!\\n59. Make two stacks of two dark tan 1x1 plates. Stack a light gray 1x1 brick with a pin-hole on each stack.\\nPlace a stack, with the hole at the front, on the front stud of the leftmost raised column of bricks. Place\\nanother stack on the back stud of this column in the same orientation.\\nOpen group 15.\\n60.1. Now we\u2019ll continue making the clock mechanism! Place a dark tan 1x2 brick with a log pattern,\\nvertically long and centered vertically, between the two stacks from the previous step.\\n60.2. Place a dark tan 1x2 plate with a horizontal bar on one long side, on the previous piece with the bar\\nat the right.\\n60.3. Find two brown 1x1 plates with a ring on one side. The ring has a stud on each side. Place one\\npiece, with the ring at the front, on the front stud of the previous piece. Place the other symmetrically\\nbehind the first.\\n60.4. Place a tan 1x2 brick with a pin-hole, vertically long, in front of you.\\n60.5. Place a tan axle/pin combo into the pin-hole of the previous piece by pushing the pin portion in from\\nthe left, so the axle extends to the left.\\n60.6. Push a medium dark gray 24 tooth gear onto the axle portion of the previous piece from the left.\\n60.7. Attach the gear assembly onto the two brown 1x1 plates with rings, with the gear at the left. The\\nteeth on this gear should mesh with the teeth on the large gear. When you spin one gear, the other gear\\nshould turn!\\n61.1. Now we\u2019ll start making the clock tower look a bit more complete! Start by placing a tan 1x8x2 arch,\\nvertically long, on the rightmost column of the clock tower. It should be directly over the clock face.\\n61.2. Place a tan 1x6x7 arched door frame with round columns, horizontally long with the round columns\\nat the front, on the front row of the clock tower, even with the left edge. Place another symmetrically on\\nthe back side of the clock tower.\\n62.1. Place a tan 1x1 scroll brick on the leftmost stud of the front piece from the previous step, with the\\nscroll at the back. Place another symmetrically on the back side of the clock tower.\\n62.2. Place a tan 2x2 inverted slope on the second and third studs from the right, on the front of the clock\\ntower, with the slope at the back. This should be right in front of the small gear. Place another\\nsymmetrically on the back side of the clock tower.\\nOpen group 16.\\n63.1. Place a dark tan 2x6 plate, horizontally long, on the front two rows of the clock tower, even with the\\nleft and front edges. Place another symmetrically on the back two rows.\\n63.2. Place a dark tan 1x8 plate, vertically long, to the right of the previous two pieces, aligned with the\\nfront of the clock tower.\\n63.3. Place a dark tan 1x1 plate to the right of the front stud of the previous piece, and another to the right\\nof the back stud of the previous piece. These two should be aligned with the right end of the clock tower.\\n63.4. Place a light brown 1x2 plate, vertically long and centered vertically, between the previous two\\npieces. Rotate the clock tower so that the clock face is now at the front.\\n64.1. Now we\u2019ll build the hands of the clock! Place a black 1x1 circular plate with a short bar sticking out\\none side in front of you with the stud facing up. The orientation of the bar is not important. This is the hour\\nhand of the clock!\\n64.2. Place a black 1x1 circular tile with an upwards pointing bar on the stud of the previous piece.\\n64.3. Now we will make the minute hand. Find a black mechanical arm. This piece is about two studs long\\nand has a clip at each end. Attach one clip onto the upwards bar from the previous piece. It should be\\nable to spin around the bar 360 degrees, just like the minute hand of a clock! Arrange the hands how you\\nwould like them, and attach them to the center stud on the clock face. You can now turn them by rotating\\nthe small gear.\\n65.1. Now we\u2019ll make another small clock. Place a gold 1x1 circular plate in front of you.\\n65.2. Place a sand green 1x1 cone on the previous piece.\\n65.3. Place a brown 2x2 circular plate with a clock pattern on it, on the previous piece. Attach this piece\\nusing the center anti-stud, so it is centered horizontally and vertically on the previous piece.\\n65.4. Now, rotate this on its side, with the circular tile at the front. Rotate it so the mark indicating the top\\nof the clock is up. Now attach it to the right 1x1 plate with a ring which is behind the large clock face. It\\nmight be difficult to find this from the front, so you might be able to remove the smaller gear and find the\\nplate with a ring from behind, then use that to guide your placement of the small clock. Don\u2019t forget to\\nreplace the gear when you are done if you take it off! Once you have the small clock placed and oriented\\ncorrectly, you can remove the tape from that tile.\\n66. Place a sand green 1x1 cone on each corner of the clock tower.\\n67.1. Place a tan 1x2x2 tall slope to the right of the front left cone from the previous step, with the slope at\\nthe left. Place another symmetrically on the right side of the clock tower.\\n67.2. Place a sand green 1x2 slope tile, with the thick side at the right, behind the left stud on the left\\npiece from the previous step. Place two more in a row behind the first, in the same orientation. Repeat\\nthese three pieces symmetrically on the right side of the clock tower.\\nOpen group 17.\\n68. Now we\u2019ll build some more of the clock mechanism! Set the clock tower aside for now. Place a tan\\n1x2 brick with a pin-hole, vertically long, in front of you.\\n69.1. Place a dark gray 4L axle with a stop into the hole on the previous piece, pushing it in from the right\\nwith the stop on the right.\\n69.2. Push a small dark gray 8 tooth gear onto the previous piece, pushing it on from the left side until it\\ntouches the 1x2 brick. Don\u2019t push too hard, we want the axle to turn freely!\\n70. Place a dark tan 2x2 plate under the 1x2 brick, extending one column to the right.\\n71. Place a light brown 1x2 plate, vertically long, on the right column of the previous piece.\\n72.1. Place a tan 2x2 inverted slope on the previous piece, with the slope at the right.\\n72.2. Place a light brown 1x2 plate, vertically long to the left of the previous piece. Its top should be even\\nwith the top of the previous piece.\\n73. Slide a tan 12 tooth bevel gear onto the axle. Push it on from the left, with the flat part of the gear at\\nthe right.\\n74. Place the clock tower in front of you, with the clock face at the right. Attach the mechanism we just\\ncreated on the clock tower, between the two tall slopes on the right column. The axle should be at the left,\\nand the teeth of the small dark gray gear should mesh with the teeth of the medium gear on the clock\\ntower. If you spin the axle, the hands on the clock should spin!\\n75.1. Now we\u2019ll make the arch at the left end of the clock tower. Place a sand green 1x1 plate behind the\\n1x1 cone at the front left corner of the clock tower. Place another in front of the cone on the back left\\ncorner.\\n75.2. Place a tan 1x6 arch, vertically long, so that it connects to both pieces from the previous step.\\n75.3. Place a sand green 1x1 slope tile on the front stud of the previous piece, with the thick side at the\\nback.\\n75.4. Place a dark tan 2x2 corner plate behind the previous piece, oriented like a Braille letter F,\\noverhanging the arch by one stud to the right.\\n75.5. Repeat steps 75.3-75.4 symmetrically on the back side of the arch.\\n76. Place a tan 1x2x2 tall slope on the front corner plate on the left arch, aligned with the left end of the\\nclock tower, with the slope at the front. Place another symmetrically behind it. Place another pair of tall\\nslopes, in the same orientation, on the two tall slopes on the right side of the clock tower.\\nOpen group 18.\\n77. Now we\u2019ll start building the roof of the clock tower, which also contains more of the mechanism for\\nturning the hands of the clock! Set the clock tower aside for now. Place a light gray 2x6 plate with holes\\nhorizontally long in front of you. The holes are hard to notice because they are between the studs, but\\nthey\u2019re there!\\n78.1. Place a dark tan 2x2 circular tile with a hole in the middle, centered vertically and horizontally, on\\nthe previous piece.\\n78.2. Place a dark tan 2x2 plate to the left of the previous piece, and another to the right of it.\\n79. Place a brown 1x2 hinge base, horizontally long with the tall side at the back, on the front row of each\\nof the previous pieces. Place two more symmetrically behind the first.\\n80.1. Find a brown 5L axle with a stop on one end. Hold the axle so the stop is at the bottom and push a\\ntan 12 tooth bevel gear onto it from the top, with the flat part of the axle on the top. Push the gear all the\\nway down to the stop.\\n80.2. Push the axle and gear up through the center hole of the 2x6 plate from the bottom. Hold onto the\\naxle so it doesn\u2019t fall through!\\n81.1. Slide a tan 1L thick liftarm down over the axle from the top. This piece looks like a hollow cylinder.\\n81.2. Slide a light gray thin bushing over top of the axle, pushing it down until it touches the previous\\npiece, and the previous piece touches the 2x2 circular tile. With this in place, the axle is secured and\\nwon\u2019t fall out! Once again, make sure you don\u2019t push the bushing down too hard. We want the axle to spin\\nfreely!\\n82. Put the clock tower back in front of you, with the clock face at the right. Place the assembly we just\\ncreated, centered vertically, between the two sets of tall slopes. The bevel gear on the roof assembly\\nshould engage with the bevel gear attached to the small gear. Now, when you turn the axle on top of the\\nclock tower, the clock hands should turn!\\nOpen group 19.\\n83.1. All that\u2019s left to do now is to make the roof! Place a sand green 4x6 plate horizontally long in front of\\nyou, with the studs down.\\n83.2. Place a brown 2x2 hinge plate on the previous piece, even with the back left corner, with the flat\\npart at the front. Place another on the back right corner in the same orientation. Keeping the hinge plates\\nat the back, flip the 4x6 plate over so the studs are up.\\n83.3. Place a sand green 1x1 slope tile on the third stud from the left on the back row, with the thick part\\nat the back. Place another on the second stud from the left on the second row from the front, with the\\nthick part at the back. Place another on the second stud from the right on the front row, with the thick part\\nat the back.\\n83.4. Repeat steps 83.1-83.3 to make the second half of the roof.\\n83.5. Attach the front roof section by attaching the hinge plates onto the hinge bases we already placed\\non the clock tower. Do this by holding the roof section flat in front of you, with the hinge plates at the back.\\nLine the hinge plates up with the base and push straight down until they both click into place, then hinge\\nthe roof down as far as it will go. Repeat this symmetrically on the back side of the clock tower.\\n84. Place a light brown 2x8 plate with holes, horizontally long and centered vertically, on top of the clock\\ntower. It should be aligned with the left and right ends of the clock tower, and the axle should stick up out\\nof the middle of it.\\n85.1. Place a dark tan 2x2 circular tile with a hole in the middle, centered horizontally on the previous\\npiece. It should go down over the axle.\\n85.2. Place a sand green 1x2 double slope, vertically long and centered vertically, on the leftmost column\\nof the roof. Rotate the clock tower so the clock face is at the front.\\n85.3. Find the inverted slope overhanging the clock face. Place a light brown 1x2 plate, horizontally long,\\non the inverted slope.\\n85.4. Assemble a window by placing a white 1x2x2 lattice into a tan 1x2x2 arched window panel. Place\\nthe window panel onto the 1x2 plate from the previous step, with the flat side of the panel at the front.\\n86.1. Place a tan 2x2 circular brick on the previous piece, even with the front of the clock tower.\\n86.2. Place a sand green 2x2 jagged cone on top of the previous piece.\\n86.3. Place a sand green unicorn horn, with the point up, into the stud on top of the previous piece.\\n86.4. Place a tan 2x2 circular brick onto the axle on top of the roof. The axle connects through an axle\\nhole in the center of the circular brick, so the circular brick should be aligned with the 2x2 circular tile on\\ntop of the roof. Place another tan 2x2 circular brick on the first one.\\n86.5. Place a sand green 2x2 jagged cone on top of the previous piece.\\n86.6. Place a sand green unicorn horn, with the point up, into the stud on top of the previous piece. You\\ncan rotate this spire to turn the clock hands!!\\n87. Place the entire hospital wing in front of you with the windows at the front. Attach the clock tower, with\\nthe clock at the front, to the hospital wing, centering it horizontally between the two small roofs. The front\\nof the clock tower should extend two studs past the front of the hospital wing so it is even with the two\\nsmall half arches overhanging to the front.\\nCongratulations! Now the Hogwarts Hospital Wing is complete!\\nThank you so much for building this set!']"}]}
