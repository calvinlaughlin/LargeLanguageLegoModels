The Story: It's a beautiful sunny day, and you've just moved into your new home, a cozy little house with a big backyard. As you step inside, you notice the bright and airy living room with large windows that let in plenty of natural light. The kitchen is equipped with everything you need to cook and prepare meals, including a stove and refrigerator. Upstairs, there are two bedrooms, each with its own window and a comfortable bed to rest on. Outside, the garden is filled with vibrant flowers and lush greenery, making it the perfect place to relax and unwind after a long day. With its simple yet charming design, this house is sure to be a wonderful home for anyone who loves the comfort and tranquility of a peaceful suburban life.Step-By-Step Instructions:Step1: Begin by building the base plate. Place the plate on a flat surface and arrange the pieces in a square shape, ensuring that the edges are aligned properly. Use the adhesive of your choice to hold them in place while you work on the next step. Step2: Next, build the walls. Take one wall piece and place it on top of two plate pieces, with the studs facing outwards. Repeat this process for the other three walls, aligning them properly as you go. Once all four walls are built, connect them to form a rectangular shape. Hold them together using the glue ofyour choice.  Step3: Build the roof by placing the three roof tiles ontop of each other, starting from the back wall and working your way forward. Ensure that they are evenly spaced and properly aligned. To secure them, apply a thin layer of gluestick to the underside ofeach tile and press it firmly onto the wall, using a gentle rocking motion to eliminate any air bubbles that may form.Repeat the same processfor the remaining two rooftiles, overlapping them slightly to ensure a watertight seal.Finally, attach the chimney to one side ofthe roof, following the manufacturer'sinstructions for proper placement and alignment.   Step4: Construct the door frame by attaching the frame pieces together, forming a rectangle with an open top and bottom. Attach the hinges to both sides of thestructure, allowing the doors to open and close smoothly. Add a door and any additional details, such as a knob or lock, to complete the entrance to your home. Similarly, construct the window frames by assembling the individual pieces into rectangles with open tops andbottoms.Attach these frames tothe walls on either sideof the house, spacing themevenly apart. Complete the windows by adding glass pieces (not included in this list) or other decorative elements to give them a more realistic appearance.    Step5: Add the furniture and other details. Depending on your personal preferences and the sets you have available, choose the items you want to include in your build and assemble them according to their individual instructions. Some options might include a sofa, armchair, coffee table, or even a pet or two to keep you company. Don't forget to add any lighting fixtures or decorations that will help bring your house to life!Step6: Final touches and display. Stand back and admire your handiwork!
