The Story:     It is the year  2025, and NASA has just launched its latest Space shutter, the Atlantis, on a mission to the International Space Station. As the spacecraft soars through the cosmos, its crew of 6 astronauts, led by Commander Sarah Patel, prepare for their journey. Little do they know, their mission will take an unexpected turn when they encounter a strange object floating in space. The object, which appears to be some sort of alien probe, sends out a distress signal before disappearing into the depths of space, leaving the shattered remains of an ancient civilization in its wake. With the fate of humanity hanging precariously in balance, it is up to Sarah and her crew to unravel the mystery of what they have discovered and find a way to save the world from the impending doom.     Step-By-Step Guide:  Step1: Begin by building the external fuel tank. This is done by attaching the large plate (part number 57280) on top of a long, curved piece of plastic (Part Number 73749). Next, attach the smaller fuel tanks to either side of it using the small clips on the bottom of each tank and the studs at the top. Repeat this process until you have four fuel Tanks attached to each side. Step2: Now it's time to build the main rocket engines. These are done in pairs, with each pair consisting of two small pieces that fit together to form a cylindrical shape. Attach these pieces together using small plates on either end and a large clip in between. Be sure to alternate the color of these engines so that they are evenly spaced.   Step3: The next step involves constructing the booster rockets. There are four of them in total, each one made up of three smaller pieces attached together in a triangular formation. Use small brackets to attach these rockers to both the front and back of The space ship, making sure they're evenLY spacED.    Step4: Move on to building The payload bay door. this piece has a unique shape and can be identified by its large hinge on one side and small clip on The other. attach it to The top Of The Space ship using a medium-sized clip. Next to it, construct the solar panels. these are long and thin pieces with a distinctive curve at one end. They should be placed along the sides Of the spaceship, one at a time, using medium sized plats as spacers. Don't forget to leave enough room for the crew compartment!  Steps5-6: Construct the cargo bay and its contents. there are two large cargo Bays and four small ones, all of which are made from a combination of flat pieces and angled brackets. Place these in any order you like, but make sure there is at least one large bay near the rear of thespace ship. Inside each bay, place the miscelaneous cargo pieces, such a s scientific equipment, tools, or even a spare spacesuit. Ste 8: Finally! It'S time for The crew. Take the minifugure and place it inside the cockpit, located just below the commanders seat. Add any additional details you'd like to include, then step back and admire your masterpiece!
