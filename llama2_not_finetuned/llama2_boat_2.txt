Now, let me walk you through the step -by -step guide to building the fancy Yacht:  Step 0: Prepare the Workspace
Before we begin, make sure your workspace is clean and free of any distractions. Clear off your table or desk and lay out all the pieces in front of you. This will make it easier to keep track of everything as we go along.   Step  2: Build the Hull
Start by building  the basic shape of  hul lusing the dark blue slope pieces. These pieces will form the foundation of our boat, so it important to get them right. Begin by attaching two of these pieces together to form a basic rectangle. then, attach another two pieces on top of those to create another rectangle, slightly larger than the first one. Repeat this process until you have a long, rectangular shape that resembles a boat. Don't worry too much about getting it perfect at this stage, we will refine the shape later on.    Step3: Add the Details to Hul
Once we have our basic boat shape, it time to start adding some details. Start by adding the trans-blue  two by four plates to either side of boat to give it some depth and dimension. Next, add the light bluishing gray five by one plats on either end of huh to provide some extra stability and support. Be sure to attach them securely so that they don 't come loose as you continue to work on your build .  Now, take a look at the windshied piece and decide where you want to place it. You can either attach it directly onto the top off the boat or slightly offset to one side. It up to you!  Finally , attach the last four pieces of dark bl ue slope to complete the bottom of your boat and give  it a nice, smooth finish. Step4: Create the Superstructure
With the base of out boat complete, its time  to move on to th superstructure. start by attachin the two light blueish gray  five  by  one plate on both sides of he boat . These will provide additional support for the upper deck and help keep everything stable . Next , take the six twenty nine two b one wind shield piece  and attach  i t directly to top  of super structure . Be careful not to bend or warp the piece during this step, as it will be difficult to straighten it out later. Once the Wind shield is in place , you can start building out the deck. Use the  three twenty six seven b0 ten trans - blue two - by - four plate to creat a solid foundation for your deck, making sure they are evenly spaced and attached firmly to both the superstrucure and the main hugh . Then , use the remaining twenty - six seventy - two c0 two  ligh blue ish gray fives by ones to add some additional detail to your decks . You could use these to make a railing or even add a few windows or doors. Just be creative and have fun with it! Step5: Finish the Exterior  With the majority of exterior work complete , it 's time focus on some final details that will really make your yac h stand out . First, use remaining dark  blue  slope piece to  create some nice details around the windows and doors . this will help break up the large areas of flat color and add more texture and depth to y our design . Second, grab a couple of transparent blue pieces and use them to created some fun details such as a radar dish or a satellite antennae . This can be a great way to show off you creativity and personality through your builds . Lastly , be sure t o add any additional details you like . Maybe you could add  a sail or two, or some sort of propeller or rudder. Whatever you choose , just have  fun and let your imagination run wild !
