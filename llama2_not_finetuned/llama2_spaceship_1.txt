Provide step-by-step instructions for a LEGO build with this description: a Star Wars style spacecraft. Make sure that each step is doable in the real world and that each piece is a real lego piece, include the part number. Firstly, state every lego piece that you will need in the build. Then, create a small story about the build. Finally, create the comprehensive step by step guide of the builds.
Step 1: Gathering the necessary pieces
To build this Star wars style Spacecraft, you'll need the following leGO pieces:

* 75198-1 X-Wing Starfighter (This is the base of our space craft, and it's a great starting point for building the cockpit and wings)
  * 45001-2 Minifigure Co-Pilot (For the pilot of your space ship) 
  
The story behind this build is that the Rebel Alliance has just received a tip about a hidden Imperial base on a remote planet. They need a skilled pilot to fly a stolen Imperial TIE fighter to the planet and gather intel on the Empire'ss plans. The pilot, a seasoned Rebellion soldier, has managed to sneak onto the Imperial ship undetected and is now ready to take off and embark on his mission to save the galaxy!
Now, here are the detailed steps to build your very own star wars Style SpaceCraft: Step 2: Building the Cockpit

Next, attach the control panel piece(44996)to the frontof the Windshied, using the Technic bricks(3038) as supports. Add the radar dish(76139) on top off thecontrol panel, ensuring itis centered and securely attached. Step3: Creating the Wings
