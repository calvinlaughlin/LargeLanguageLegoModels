before you start building here are some terms well be using  in front offront towards you  behindback away from you  up towards the ceiling  down towards the floor  stud the bump on a lego brick example a 2x1 brick has two studs on it  vertically going from front to behind  horizontally going from left to right  upright pointing up towards the ceiling  that oneppp previously placed piece  plate piece with studs  tile smooth piece without studs unless otherwise specified  symmetrically a mirror image example if you place a 2x1 brick with technic connector on the front wall at the right connector to the front and then place another such piece symmetrically on the back wall at the right the technic connector of the second piece should point to the back since it will be placed symmetrically  centeredvertically even amount of space in front of and behind the piece  centeredhorizontally even amount of space left and right of the piece  row studs lined up horizontally left to

visual instructions that come with each kit pdf versions are always online at legocom httpswwwlegocomenusservicebuildinginstructions76917 as low vision users may benefit from viewing the instructions on a personal device where they can zoom in on content and use assistive technologies to enhance the visuals sorting the pieces to begin a successful build it helps to sort the pieces into groups bags or small containers have a friend or family member do this in advance following the instructions below you will see that the pieces should be sorted according to the building steps in the kit doing this in advance makes locating the pieces for each step easier see below on how to sort the pieces to correspond to the steps in this set number the containers using letters az numbers or meaningful names the parts will be sorted into one or a small number of steps in the instructions example steps 13 means collect all the parts used in steps 1 2 and 3 and put them in one container this lego set comes with two bags labeled 12 a sticker sheet a loose car base and an instruction booklet sort the pieces into groups as described below note that where there are multiple colors of the same brick in a step the colors will be split across two groups to make telling the difference easier for the builder lego includes a few spare parts in case you lose something set these into their own group away

say phrases along the lines of 2 studs in from the left i mean count two studs from the left and place it on the second stud for builders with low vision or a sighted building partner may want to

users may benefit from viewing the instructions on a personal device where they can zoom in on content and use assistive technologies to enhance the visuals sorting the pieces to begin a successful build it helps to sort the pieces into groups bags or small containers have a friend or family member do this in advance following the instructions below you will see that the pieces should be sorted according to the building steps in the kit doing this in advance makes locating the pieces for each step easier see below on how to sort the pieces to correspond to the steps in this set number the containers using letters az numbers or meaningful names the parts will be sorted into one or a small number of steps in the instructions example steps 13 means collect all the parts used in steps 12

need them later note that there are lego pieces that have printed designs on them that should be should be facing a certain way on the build and its orientation can not be determined by touch so ask
