### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Step 1: The Base
1. Take a **2 x 4 Plate (3020)** and place it horizontally.
2. Connect another **2 x 4 Plate (3020)** directly behind it, forming an 8-stud long base.

#### Step 2: Extending the Base
1. Attach a **2 x 6 Plate (3795)** to one side of the base, extending its length further.
2. Repeat with another **2 x 6 Plate (3795)** directly behind the first one, continuing to extend the base.

#### Step 3: Structure Formation
1. Use two **1 x 4 Brick (3010)** and place them vertically on each side nearest to the front of the extended base.
2. Connect two **1 x 2 Brick (3004)** behind the vertical bricks on each side.

#### Step 4: Mid-Structure Support
1. Add two **2 x 2 Plate (3022)** in the middle to reinforce the structure.
2. Place two **1 x 2 Plate (3023)** horizontally next to the 2 x 2 plate to fill the gaps.

#### Step 5: Rear Section
1. Attach one **1 x 2 Brick (3004)** on both sides of the shuttle's rear.

1. Place another set of **2 x 4 Plate (3020)** side by side at the front end.
2. Attach a single **1 x 1 Brick with Stud on Side (87087)** on either side of the front end, these will act as attachment points for the canopy.

#### Step 8: Cockpit Canopy
1. Position the **Transparent Canopy (92579)** to snap onto the 1 x 1 bricks with studs, forming the cockpit.

#### Step 9: Fuselage Slope
1. Place a **2 x 2 Slope Brick (3039)** at the front center, just behind the nose cone.
2. Use two **4 x 1 Slope Brick (60477)** on each side behind the 2 x 2 slope.

#### Step 10: Rear Finishing
1. Attach a **1 x 2 Plate with Handle on Side (11476)** to each side rear upwards.
2. Place a **Red Round 1 x 1 Plate (4073)** on each of the handles, acting as the shuttle's rear engines.
