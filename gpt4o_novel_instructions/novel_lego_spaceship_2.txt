### Small Story About the Build

In a galaxy far, far away, the Rebel Alliance is in a desperate need of a new type of spaceship that is both agile and powerful enough to counter the Galactic Empire's TIE fighters. The Alliance's top engineers have been secretly working on a prototype, code-named "X-Wing Starfighter," in a hidden base on planet Yavin IV. This LEGO set lets you build your own mini version of this iconic ship and join the Rebel cause to bring balance to the galaxy!

### Comprehensive Step-by-Step Guide

**Step 1: Building the Base Structure**
1. Take the **Plate 4x12** (Part 3029) and place it on your workspace. This will be the main base of your spaceship.

**Step 2: Creating the Wings**
1. Attach a **Wing Plate 3x12** (Part 30334) to each side of the **Plate 4x12**. These will create a balanced wing structure on both sides of the base plate.

**Step 3: Constructing the Body**
1. Place one **Brick 2x4** (Part 3001) at the center of the **Plate 4x12**, towards the front.
2. Behind the first **Brick 2x4**, stack two more **Brick 2x4** pieces, forming a central column.

**Step 4: Adding the Engine Details**
1. Attach a **Slope 30 1x2x2/3** (Part 85984) on each side at the top of the column, sloping downwards to give a streamlined look to the spaceship.
2. Place a **Brick 2x2 Round with Axle Hole** (Part 3941) on top of each **Slope 30** piece for engine thrusters.

**Step 5: Defining the Cockpit Area**
1. Align the **Bracket 1x2 - 2x2 Inverted** (Part 99781) on the front sides of the column.
2. Snap the **Cockpit 6x4x2** (Part 2867) on top, ensuring it fits snugly with the brackets.

**Step 6: Final Touches**
1. Place a **Plate 2x2 Round** (Part 4032) beneath each engine thruster to add extra detail.
2. Finish the wings by placing a **Tile 1x2 Grille** (Part 2412b) towards the rear on each wing for aesthetic detail.

**Step 7: Adding the Pilot**
1. Position the **Minifigure Star Wars Pilot** in the cockpit, securing them in place.
