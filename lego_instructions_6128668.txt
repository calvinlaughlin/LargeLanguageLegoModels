The image provided is an instruction manual from a LEGO set. It consists of a series of images showing an animated figure (presumably a child) building a LEGO set, followed by instructions on using a LEGO brick separator. Below is a blind-friendly description of each step including the necessary pieces by color, shape, and size:

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

#### Frames 1-4: Unpacking and Starting the Build
1. **Frame 1:** 
   - An animated figure (child) is opening the LEGO box.
     - The box is gray and features the LEGO logo and images of assembled LEGO pieces.
     - A bag labeled with the number "2" is seen.
2. **Frame 2:**
   - The child has opened bag 1.
     - There's a pile of LEGO pieces in various colors on the table.
3. **Frame 3:**
   - The child is actively building using pieces from bag 1.
4. **Frame 4:**
   - The child has opened bag 2.
     - Additional LEGO pieces are now on the table and the child is continuing to build.

#### How to Use a Brick Separator:
1. **Upper Left Image:**
   - To remove a flat LEGO piece from the top of another, use the orange LEGO brick separator tool.
     - The separator is orange, flat, and has a raised section resembling a wedge.
     - Place the wedge section under the flat piece and push down to separate the bricks.
2. **Upper Right Image:**
   - To remove a brick piece attached on top of another, use the indentations on the separator.
     - Align the separator's lower section with the edge of the top brick and push down to lift the brick off.
3. **Lower Left Image:**
   - To remove flat bricks (tiles) placed side-by-side, use the flat edge of the separator.
     - Position the flat edge underneath the tile and push upwards.
4. **Lower Right Image:**
   - To remove bricks or plates connected with studs, use the handle of the separator.
     - Insert the handle under the studs and push upwards to detach.

#### Describing the Pieces:
Each type of piece mentioned here can be identified using Lego’s own nomenclature and part numbers available on their inventory databases.

1. **Standard Brick (2x4):**
   - Dimensions: 2 studs wide by 4 studs long (7.8mm x 32mm)
   - Example ID: 3001

2. **Flat Tile (1x4):**
   - Dimensions: 1 stud wide by 4 studs long (7.8mm x 32mm)
   - Example ID: 2431

3. **Flat Tile (2x2):**
   - Dimensions: 2 studs wide by 2 studs long (15.6mm x 15.6mm)
   - Example ID: 3068b

4. **Brick Separator (Orange Tool):**
   - Example ID: 96874
   - Note: It has a flat wedge side for prying pieces apart and a handle with studs and indentations for better grip.

### Placement Context:
- The child initially sets out the pieces (Frames 1 and 2), then builds with the pieces, referring to bag numbers for sorting. These initial steps show organization and starting assembly without specific instructions for building.
- The later steps (using the brick separator) guide how to detach bricks that are incorrectly placed or need to be repositioned, ensuring ease in the building process.

### Additional Notes:
Each step should logically follow the previous one, ensuring that pieces fit snugly in place as shown in the diagram. When assembling or disassembling, the user should handle pieces carefully to align studs (the small cylindrical bumps on top of the bricks) with the corresponding holes on the underside of the other bricks. The brick separator can be very helpful for disassembling errors without damaging the pieces. Use the appropriate method from the separator instructions based on the type and orientation of the bricks involved.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### Step 5
1. **Pieces Needed:**
   - Two pieces of a dark brown triangular slope (Brick ID: 43710)
   - Dimensions: approximately 2 x 2 x 2 (in studs)

2. **Assembly Instructions:**
   - Take each of the dark brown triangular slope pieces and position them to attach them to the main assembly.
   - Attach the first triangular slope piece to one of the sides of the assembly, ensuring the sloped side is facing outward.
   - Attach the second triangular slope piece to the opposite side, mirroring the placement of the first piece.

#### Step 6
1. **Pieces Needed:**
   - Three light gray small claw pieces (Brick ID: 11090)
   - Dimensions: approximately 1 x 1 (in studs), with a claw extension
   - Three black arm connector pieces (Brick ID: 98585)
   - Dimensions: approximately 1 x 2 (in studs), with a clip on one end to hold the claw
   
2. **Assembly Instructions:**
   - For each claw assembly:
     - Insert a light gray small claw piece into the black arm connector piece. The claw should fit into the clip side of the arm connector.
   - Attach each of the claw assemblies to designated points on the existing structure:
     - Two claw assemblies should be attached on either side at the lower part of the structure, ensuring that the claws face outward.
     - The third claw assembly should be attached at the center front of the structure, just above the triangular slope pieces.

### Placement Context:
These steps are built onto a pre-existing structure which has already been partially assembled. For correct placement:
- **Step 5**: The dark brown triangular slope pieces are added symmetrically to two opposite sides, enhancing the framework.
- **Step 6**: The claw assemblies are positioned to provide additional detailing and complexity to the overall structure, enhancing both functionality and aesthetics.

Let's go through the steps outlining the pieces and their placement for someone who is blind.

### Step 7:

1. **Brick Description:**
   - The instruction indicates the use of one piece.
   - This piece is a half-sphere with a stud on top.
   - Based on standard LEGO piece types, it matches an 88072 (2x2 dome top).

2. **Placement:**
   - Place this half-sphere on top of a central area previously assembled. The half-sphere should have its stud pointing upward.

### Step 8:

1. **Brick Description:**
   - Instruction indicates the use of four pieces.
   - Two of each: 
     - The first set of two looks like a cylindrical shape with cross-axle holes.
     - The second set of two is a longer cylindrical piece.
   - Based on standard LEGO pieces:
     - The first is likely a 11477 (round plate with open stud).
     - The second is likely a 2412b (“Technic pin with friction ridges”).

2. **Assembly and Placement:**
   - Combine one of each of the two parts together to form a sub-assembly. Repeat this process to make two identical sub-assemblies.
     - Insert the “Technic pin with friction ridges” (piece 2412b) into the "round plate with open stud" (piece 11477).
   - Place these two combined sub-assemblies onto the body of the previous assembly.
     - There are specific points, one on each side of the central half-sphere, where they attach. Ensure they face outward.

### Context:
Each piece connects to an existing structure, forming extensions to the main body, which may resemble limbs, appendage, or other mechanical parts depending on the overall model.

### Summary of Pieces:

- Step 7:
  - 1x Half-sphere (Dome top, part 88072)

- Step 8:
  - 2x Round plate with open stud (part 11477)
  - 2x Technic pin with friction ridges (part 2412b)

### Placement:

- Step 7: 
  - Place the half-sphere at the center of the current assembly with the stud pointing up.
  
- Step 8:
  - Form two sub-assemblies using each pair of pieces.
  - Attach these sub-assemblies to specified locations on either side of the main body, ensuring the components are properly aligned and fitted.

This should allow a blind user to understand the assembly process step-by-step with precise details about each component involved.

Instructions for describing the build of these LEGO pieces for the blind should be done step by step. Each step involves identifying the LEGO pieces by their dimensions and IDs from the provided list. Here is an example of how you might start:

### Step by Step LEGO Build:

#### Step 1:
1. Identify the 8x6 half-circle plate, Light Bluish Gray (4211444), and place it as the base.
2. Get four 1x1 Round Plates with Lamp Post, Light Bluish Gray (4594238) and place them symmetrically on the corners.

Continue describing each step sequentially by choosing pieces from the provided list, specifying their position (relative to previous pieces), and ensuring all are correctly identified by their shape, color, and ID. Please note that each piece should be described in reference to its ID numbers and their exact placement in relation to what has already been built.  

For a comprehensive description, each following step should continue building on top of or around the previously placed parts, ensuring that shapes and overall structure are accurately conveyed through detailed instructions.

This image shows the box art for five different LEGO Star Wars sets with ID numbers displayed prominently:

1. **Set 75091:**
   - This set features a green vehicle with movable parts, including characters associated with the scene and a droid.

2. **Set 75092:**
   - This set includes a yellow starfighter, battle environments, and several characters including droids.

3. **Set 75093:**
   - This set depicts a scene within the Death Star, featuring key locations and characters from the Star Wars series.

4. **Set 75094:**
   - This set consists of a white spaceship with black detailing and large wings, showing it in an in-flight scenario.

5. **Set 75106:**
   - This set includes a larger spacecraft, grey in color, with an action scene involving an ongoing battle and characters.

Since the image description requests instructions for someone who is blind and step-by-step assembly details including the identification of each LEGO piece with its ID numbers, it's important to note that these specific instructions need to be provided by consulting the actual instruction manuals of each set. Typically, LEGO set instructions break down each step with clear visual details of the pieces needed, the orientation of the pieces, and where to place them in the context of already built components.

Given the nature of the image and the requirement for detailed assembly instructions with LEGO piece IDs:

- You should start by looking up each set ID number on the official LEGO website or a LEGO database like BrickLink or Brickset.
- Obtain the detailed PDF instruction manuals for each set.
- Using the instruction manuals, you can describe each brick’s dimensions carefully (number of studs in length and width, shape, color) and provide the LEGO piece ID number.
- For placement, describe how each piece fits with respect to the already constructed part, considering directional orientation (front, back, top, bottom, left, right).
 
Unfortunately, I'm unable to provide the full detailed step-by-step instructions with LEGO piece IDs and their exact placement within this text without referring to the actual instruction manuals. You would need to access these manuals to proceed with the assembly instructions for someone who is visually impaired.

You can access PDF versions of LEGO instructions on the LEGO website:
1. Go to LEGO Customer Service – Building Instructions: [LEGO Building Instructions](https://www.lego.com/en-us/service/buildinginstructions)
2. Enter the set number (75091, 75092, 75093, 75094, 75106) to find and download the specific building instructions.
