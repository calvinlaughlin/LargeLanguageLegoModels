   - This step appears to be focused on adding components to an already partially constructed vehicle, which has a main body, four legs, a turret with a large gun, and several colors such as light grey, dark grey, red, green, yellow, and black elements.

2. **Pieces and Their Details**:
   - **Yellow 1x1 Brick with Stud on One Side (2 pieces, Piece ID: 4070)**:
     - These bricks need to be positioned at the back of the vehicle in a symmetrical fashion, one on each side. They extend outwards and connect to the red elements already in place.
   - **Light Grey 2x4 Slope (2 pieces, Piece ID: 32161)**:
     - Attach these slopes exactly on top of the yellow bricks added in this step, creating a smooth, descending surface that covers the yellow and red bricks.
   - **Black Technic Ball Joints (2 pieces, Piece ID: 6628)**:
     - These should be affixed at the new assembly’s outermost sides and are likely connected to mechanized elements of the build. There are spherical components that snap into these joints, likely for the legs.

3. **Placement Instructions**:
   - **Yellow 1x1 Bricks**:
     - Attach these bricks on the rear red section of the vehicle assembly. Ensure that the studded side faces outwards, as other elements will be connected here in subsequent steps.
   - **Light Grey 2x4 Slopes**:
     - Place these slopes over the newly added yellow bricks, providing a streamlined structure that extends the rear forward-flaring look.
   - **Black Technic Ball Joints**:
     - Affix the ball joints' sockets onto the newly placed slopes. Each joint should connect just above the red and yellow components, with the ball element of the joint facing outward.

4. **Context**:
   - At the end of this step, the vehicle should have an enhanced rear structure with yellow and red bricks covered by light grey slopes, readiness for the next steps is key, as the new ball joints indicate movement facilitation for leg appendages or similar components.

This complete assembly demands careful attention to detail, ensuring all parts are placed securely and symmetrically to maintain structural integrity. Identifying exact part numbers adds the precision needed to match these pieces accurately.
