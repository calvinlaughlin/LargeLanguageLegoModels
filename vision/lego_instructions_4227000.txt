### Step 3:

1. **Current Assembly**:
    - A white L-shaped piece is constructed on a flat surface. 
    - The horizontal part of the L has dimensions of 1x8 (8 studs along its length and 1 stud wide).
    - Four studs on the left of this horizontal piece have two gray 1x2 pieces stacked.
    - The vertical part of the L extends upwards with a black 1x1 piece at the bottom. On top of it are two gray 1x1 pieces stacked.

2. **Instruction**:
    - Take an additional gray 1x1 piece (identifiable as LEGO part number 3024).
    - Place this piece directly on top of the existing stacked gray 1x1 piece on the vertical part of the L.

### Step 4:

1. **Current Assembly**:
    - We continue from the prior assembly which has the gray 1x1 added to the top of the vertical part of the L.

2. **Instruction**:
    - Take a tall, white 1x1 piece (this is likely a 1x1x3 brick, LEGO part number 2453 or similar).
    - Place it directly on top of the newly added gray 1x1 piece, thus extending the vertical part further up by this white 1x1x3 piece.

### Summary:

The base construction is an L-shaped piece made of a white 1x8 plate and a black 1x1 at the junction of the L, with gray pieces stacked on top. Initially, the vertical segment has three gray 1x1 pieces. Step three adds another gray 1x1, and step four completes the vertical extension by adding the tall white 1x1x3 brick on top.

### Placement Summary:
- **Gray 1x1 pieces (3024)**: Stack each piece procedural (step 3).
- **White 1x1x3 piece (2453)**: On top of gray 1x1, step 4.

This builds up the vertical segment of the L-shaped assembly.

The image instructs on step 16 of assembling a Lego model. Here is a detailed description of each piece needed and its placement:

1. **Piece Identification:**
   - **Yellow 1x1 Tile (Element ID 3070b):**
     - Size: 1x1 stud.
     - Color: Yellow.
     - Shape: Flat tile (smooth on top).
   - **White 1x1 Slope (Element ID 60478):**
     - Size: 1x1 stud.
     - Color: White.
     - Shape: Slope or wedge.

2. **Placement:**
   - Step 16 requires placing these pieces on the model in specific locations:
     - **Yellow 1x1 Tile:**
       - Place this tile on the top right corner of the rear fin of the spaceship. The fin is the triangular vertical section towards the back of the spaceship.
     - **White 1x1 Slope:**
       - Place one slope piece on the left and one on the right of the rear fin's base. The pieces should be placed symmetrically on each side.

### Contextual Instructions:

1. **The Rear Fin:**
   - At step 16, the spaceship should already have its main rear fin constructed. The fin is white and includes smaller grey areas that denote panels or details.
   - Visualize the rear fin divided into top and bottom sections: the top section is flat and the bottom section attaches to the spaceship.

2. **Placement of the Tiles:**
   - The **yellow 1x1 tile** goes at the very top edge of the rear fin.
   - The **white 1x1 slope pieces** are placed at the lower corners of the fin, where the fin connects to the rest of the spaceship. Each slope should rest at the base of the fin on both the left and right sides, at the outermost studs.

Following these instructions will ensure accurate assembly completion as shown in the provided instructions for step 16.

Certainly! I will describe the approximate pieces and instructions involved based on the set images. However, please note that because detailed step-by-step instructions are not visible within this image, I cannot identify each piece with absolute certainty or obtain exact LEGO ID numbers. Descriptions will be general and based on visible components:

### Set 4492
**Mini Star Destroyer:**
- **Base:** Begin with a flat rectangular base, possibly 2x8 or 2x6 in size.
- **Main Structure:** Add progressively smaller, sloping bricks (likely triangular wedge plates) to create the tapered shape typical of a Star Destroyer.
- **Detailing:** Use smaller 1x1 round plates or tiles for the bridge area and detailing along the sides.
- **Colors:** Primarily gray with potentially black or dark gray detailing.

### Set 4493
**Mini Venator-Class Republic Attack Cruiser:**
- **Base:** Start with a gray plate, likely 4x10 or larger.
- **Top Hull:** Stack additional smaller plates and tiles, ensuring a gradual slope towards the rear.
- **Bridge:** Create the bridge area using smaller 1x4 bricks and tiles or 1x1 plates.
- **Colors:** Mostly gray with some dark gray or black for detailing.

### Set 4494

### General Placement Context:

1. **Base Layer:**
    - Place the largest rectangular or wedge-shaped pieces first to form a foundational base layer.
    - Ensure that the base layer forms the rough outline or base of the respective model (e.g., Star Destroyer shape for 4492).

2. **Mid-Layers:**
    - Stack progressively smaller bricks or wedge plates above the base layer to shape the main form.
    - For instance, in 4493, stack thinner plates or bricks to form the sloping look of the Venator.

3. **Detailing and Final Touches:**
    - Add the smallest pieces last to complete detailing and small structures (like bridges, turrets, and cockpits).
    - Fit smaller plates or round tiles where required to detail the final look.

By visually identifying these consistencies and structures, the general steps should be easier to follow by touch and logical placement. For sourcing detailed LEGO parts and IDs, consulting a resource like BrickLink.com would be beneficial using the respective LEGO set numbers.
