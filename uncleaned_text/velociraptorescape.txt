The box is green with red slash marks on it. It has a Jurassic Park 30th Anniversary logo at the top left.
The image shows a velociraptor knocking down an enclosure wall to escape! Robert Muldoon, holding a
tranquilizer gun, leans out from the guard tower above the enclosure. Dr. Ellie Sattler tries to lure the
velociraptor away by waving a hot dog at it as she drives and ATV through the jungle!
The top of the box shows a life sized image of the Dr. Ellie Sattler minifigure.
The back of the box shows an image of all the included components, including the two minifigures, ATV,
velociraptor, and accessories. It also shows the enclosure and tower on their own. An inset view shows
that you can spin a drum to raise and lower a chain holding food for the velociraptor. Another inset shows
some of the larger pieces used, highlighting the fact that this set is easier to build than some of the more
complex sets.
The build is 137 pieces, and 93 building steps.
Welcome to text-based instructions from Bricks for the Blind. Before you start building, here are some
terms we’ll be using:
- In Front of/Front: towards you.
- Behind/Back: away from you.
- Up: towards the ceiling.
- Down: towards the floor.
- Stud: the bump on a LEGO brick. Example: A 2x1 brick has two studs on it.
- Vertically: going from front to behind.
- Horizontally: going from left to right.
- Upright: pointing up towards the ceiling.
- That one/ppp: previously placed piece.
- Plate: piece with studs.
- Tile: smooth piece without studs (unless otherwise specified)
- Symmetrically: a mirror image. Example: If you place a 2x1 brick with technic connector on the front wall
at the right, connector to the front, and then place another such piece symmetrically on the back wall, at
the right, the technic connector of the second piece should point to the back, since it will be placed
symmetrically.
- Centered-vertically: even amount of space in front of and behind the piece
- Centered-horizontally: even amount of space left and right of the piece.
- Row: studs lined up horizontally (left to right/side to side).
- Column: studs lined up upright or vertically (top to bottom/back to front).
For builders with low vision, or a sighted building partner who may want to follow along with the printed
visual instructions that come with each kit, PDF versions are always online at LEGO.com:
(https://www.lego.com/en-us/service/buildinginstructions/76957) As low vision users may benefit
from viewing the instructions on a personal device where they can zoom in on content and use assistive
technologies to enhance the visuals.
Sorting the pieces:
To begin a successful build, it helps to sort the pieces into groups, bags or small containers. Have a
friend or family member do this in advance following the instructions below. You will see that the pieces
should be sorted according to the building steps in the kit. Doing this in advance makes locating the
pieces for each step easier. See below on how to sort the pieces to correspond to the steps in this set.
Number the containers using letters A-Z, numbers or meaningful names. The parts will be sorted into one
or a small number of steps in the instructions. Example: Steps 1-3 means collect all the parts used in
steps 1, 2 and 3, and put them in one container.
This LEGO set comes with three bags labeled 1-3, a paper bag containing the velociraptor, some large
loose pieces, and three instruction booklets labeled 1-3. Sort the pieces into groups as described below.
Note that where there are multiple colors of the same brick in a step, the colors will be split across two
groups to make telling the difference easier for the builder! LEGO includes a few spare parts in case you
lose something. Set these into their own group away from the rest, in case you need them later.
A note for helpers: this set does not have numbered steps. I’ll use the page numbers to identify which
pieces go in which groups for sorting! I’ll make numbered steps in the instructions, with the corresponding
page in parenthesis.

Building Instructions:
Open bag 1.
Open velociraptor group 1 (Book 1, pages 6-13)
1. (Pages 6 & 7) We’ll start by building a velociraptor! This tan and brown dinosaur walks upright on two
large back legs and has two small arms. Place a raptor body in front of you, with the tail at the right. The
body has five holes, two on the front side, two on the back side, and one on the top left for the neck.
2. (Pages 6 & 7) Attach the raptors left arm to the left hole on the front side of the body. The arm should
hang down and the claw should be on the left. If it doesn’t, you probably have the right arm. Attach the
right arm symmetrically on the back side of the body.
3. (Pages 8 & 9) Attach the left leg to the right hole on the front side of the body. The leg should hang
down and the toes should point to the left. If it doesn’t, you probably have the right leg. Attach the right leg
symmetrically on the back side of the body.
4. (Pages 8 & 9) Place a black 2L pin into the neck hole on the left side of the body.
5. (Pages 10 & 11) Place the raptor’s head in front of you, with the teeth on the left pointing down. Attach
the lower jaw to the head, with the teeth pointing up. The lower jaw should click into place and hinge open
and closed.
6. (Pages 12 & 13) Attach the head, with the mouth on the left, onto the pin on the left side of the
velociraptor.
Main build 1: Guard tower with destroyable wall.
1. (Pages 14 & 15) Now we’ll build a guard tower to watch the velociraptor and keep it away from park
visitors! Start by placing a light green 8x9 base brick in front of you. This piece has three sides with 1x4
recesses on them, and one side with a 1x4 plate overhanging. Place the overhanging 1x4 plate on your
right.
2. (Pages 14 & 15) Place a green 2x2 curved slope tile, with the cut out at the back, on the third and
fourth studs from the left on the front row, so it overhangs one stud to the front. This piece should be in
the front 1x4 recess. Place another to the right of the first one, then repeat these two pieces
symmetrically on the back side.
3. (Pages 16 & 17) Place a green 2x4 plate, vertically long and centered vertically, on the leftmost column
of the base so it overhangs one stud to the left. This piece should be in the left recess.
4. (Pages 18 & 19) Place a light green 4x8 half circle plate, with the flat side on the right, on the anti-stud
of the previous piece. “Anti-stud” is a term for the portion of a LEGO piece which accepts studs, like the
bottom of a plate.
5. (Pages 18 & 19) Place a green 2x2 curved slope tile, centered vertically with the cut out at the right, on
the third and fourth column from the left so it attaches to the previous piece and a 2x4 plate.
6. (Pages 18 & 19) Place a brown 1x1 swirled cone on the front stud on the third column from the left.
This is a little pile of poop. Gross!
7. (Pages 20 & 21) Place a light gray 2x8x6 door frame, with the 1x8 top row of studs at the back, on the
raised part of the back two rows. This will be the back wall of the tower.
Open group 2.
8. (Pages 22 & 23) Place a light gray 1x2 brick, vertically long, in front of the left stud of the piece from the
previous step. Place another in front of the right stud of the piece from the previous step.

between the front studs of the 2x8x6 door frame.
10. (Pages 22 & 23) Place a light gray 1x4 brick, vertically long, in front of the left 1x2 brick from step 8.
Place another in front of the right 1x2 brick.
11. (Pages 24 & 25) Place a light gray 1x6x5 support girder with an x-frame inside, vertically long, on the
left piece from the previous step so it is even with the front of the build. Place another on the right piece
from the previous step. These are the two side walls of the tower.

back row of the back wall of the tower.
19. (Pages 36 & 37) Place a light blue 1x2 tile, vertically long, in front of the left stud of the piece from the
previous step. Place it so that there is a one stud gap between it and the previous piece.. Place another in
front of the right stud of the piece from the previous step. The gate will slide into the gap later on.
20. (Pages 36 & 37) Place a yellow 1x4 tile, horizontally long, between the back studs of the previous two
pieces.
21. (Pages 36 & 37) Place a red 1x4 tile with a stud on each end, horizontally long, in front of the previous
piece.
Open group 3.

gap between the back row and the third row from the back. Slide the gate down through this gap, using
the red handle on top to slide it down, or to lift it out.
28. (Pages 44 & 45) Place a green 2x16 plate, vertically long, on the right column of anti-stud of the guard
tower. This is the 1x4 that overhangs to the right. Place the 2x16 so its back row is even with the back of
the 1x4 overhang.
29. (Pages 46 & 47) Place a green 2x2 curved slope tile, with the cut out on the left, on the back two rows
of the previous piece so it attaches to the overhang of the guard tower as well. Place another in front of
the first.
