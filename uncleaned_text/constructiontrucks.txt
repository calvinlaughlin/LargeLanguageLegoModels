imaginative play.
LEGO City Great Vehicles
Kids grow up surrounded by amazing vehicles and machines. With LEGO City building sets they get to
explore them up close with realistic models and fun characters that inspire open-ended, imaginative play
without limits.
Construction toy set for kids aged 4+ – Join your preschooler for a fun build-and-play experience with this
LEGO® City Construction Trucks and Wrecking Ball Crane (60391) set.
What’s in the box? – Everything kids need to build a transporter, wrecking ball crane, dump truck, and
derelict house, plus 3 worker minifigures and fun accessories for imaginative role play.
Fun functions for imaginative play – Kids swing the boom to demolish the derelict house, then replace the
wrecking ball attachment with the bucket to scoop the rubble into the dump truck.
Dimensions – The transporter truck measures over 3.5 in. (9 cm) high, 6.5 in. (17 cm) long, and 3.5 in. (9
cm) wide.
Minifigure accessories – The LEGO® accessories in this set include a toy crowbar, wheelbarrow, walkietalkie, and a building blueprint element.
The front of the box shows a huge construction zone with trucks and workers everywhere! The dump
trunk is at the top unloading some sand while a businesswoman walks into the site with blueprints of an
apartment complex. By the looks of it, it is of LEGO’s 60365 Apartment Building! The transporter truck is
off to the left waiting for a construction worker to bring her tools in a wheelbarrow. The wrecking ball
crane is
further down and to the right smashing its ball into a building! Another worker puts up cones and hazard
tape and radios people to stand clear while the wrecking ball is swinging! In a couple of months or so, this
area will no longer be a construction zone but a new complex for people to live in!
The back of the box shows a detailed list of what's included. It shows 3 construction workers and a
businesswoman. A wrecking ball crane, a dump truck, a transporter truck, a demolition house, cones, and
hazard tape, a shovel attachment for the crane, a green wheelbarrow, a red crowbar, a dark grey shovel,
a walkie-talkie, and blueprints of an apartment building. At the bottom, it also shows how the wrecking ball
crane can be switched out and changed to a shovel crane that can pick stuff up and put it into the dump
truck so it can be offloaded elsewhere.
The top of the box shows a picture of all the minifigures holding their tool next to the hazard tape and
cones. The businesswoman holds blueprints, the female construction worker holds a crowbar while the
other 2 male workers hold a walkie-talkie and a wheelbarrow.
The build is 235 pieces in total, for ages 4+. It includes four instruction books and 4 bags labeled 1
through 4, and also an extra bag with bigger pieces.
Bag 1 includes the pieces for the transporter truck.
Bag 2 includes the pieces for the wrecking ball crane.
Bag 3 includes the pieces for the dump truck.
Bag 4 includes the pieces for the demolition site.
Welcome to text-based instructions from LEGO for the Blind. Before you start building, here are some
terms we may be using:
- Front: towards you.
- Back: away from you.
- Up: towards the ceiling.
- Down: towards the floor.
- Stud: the bump on a LEGO brick. Example: A 2x1 brick has 2 studs on it.
- Tile: No studs, unless specified
- Gap: part lower than the surrounding area.
- Vertically: going from front to behind.
- Horizontally: going from left to right.
- Upright: pointing up towards the ceiling.
- Symmetrically: a mirror image. Example: If you place a 2x1 brick with technic connector on the front
wall at the right, connector to the front, and then place another such piece symmetrically on the back
wall, at the right, the technic connector of the second piece should point to the back, since it will be
placed symmetrically.
- Centered vertically: even amount of space in front of and back of the piece
- Centered horizontally: even amount of space left and right of the piece.

For builders with low vision, or a sighted building partner may want to follow along with the printed visual
instructions that come with each kit, or PDF versions are always online at LEGO.com for each set:
(https://www.lego.com/en-us/service/buildinginstructions/60391) As low vision users may benefit
from viewing the instructions on a personal device where they can zoom in on content and use assistive
technologies to enhance the visuals.
Sorting the pieces:

To begin a successful build, it helps to sort the pieces into groups, bags or small containers. Have a
friend or family member do this in advance following the instructions below. You will see that the pieces
should be sorted according to the building steps in the kit. Doing this in advance makes locating the
pieces for each step easier. See below on how to sort the pieces to correspond to the steps in this set.
Number the containers using letters A-Z, numbers, or meaningful names. The parts will be sorted into one
or a small number of steps in the instructions. Example: Steps 1-3 means collect all the parts used in
steps 1,2 and 3, and put them in one container.
This LEGO set comes with 4 large bags labeled 1 through 4, and 4 sets of instructions. It also comes with
an unnumbered bag that contains the big/unique pieces. Open this bag and sort the pieces into the
groups as follows. The 2 8x10 light blue bricks with walls on both sides should be placed in group 2. The
black 4x10 brick with 4 pegs should be placed in group 7. The yellow 4x6 cockpit with walls should be
added to group 8. The 6x16 car frame should be placed in group 12. Lastly, sort the light grey 6x12 plate
into group 15. Sort the pieces into groups or piles as described below. Note that where there are multiple
colors of the same brick in a step, the colors will be split into 2 groups to make telling the difference easier
for the builder! LEGO includes a few spare parts in case you lose something. Set these into their own
group away from the rest, in case you need them later. Note that there are LEGO pieces that have printed
designs on them that should be should be facing a certain way on the build and its orientation can not be
determined by touch, so ask your helper which sides of the tiles have the 2 white circles or which way the
circles are facing; make a mental note of the orientation of the tiles for later.
The steps that include printed tiles are as follows:
Book 1:
46-47.
50-51.
Book 2:
26-27.
Book 3:
42-43.
Book 4:

aside your build again.
Group 16 — Door
22-23. Locate 1 light grey 2x4x6 door frame, 1 maroon red door, 1 dark blue 2x4 brick, and a 1x1 green
circular plate. Have the door upright and vertical, and make sure the inner walls are thinner towards you.
Next, feel the upper part of the door frame and make sure that there are holes and also that the door
handle is on the right side. Then place the green 1x1 on the door handle facing you. Then insert the left
side of the door into the left side of the door frame and snap it on. Then place the 2x4 brick on top so that
there is no overhang.
24-25. Bring back your build and place the door into the 2x4 gap in the center, then put it aside again.
Group 17 — Light
26-27. Locate 2 light grey 2x4 plates and 1 dark grey 2x4 brick. Horizontally place one plate on top of the
brick and then the brick on top of the other plate. 
28-29. Then locate 2 tan 2x2 corner bricks and 1 light brown 1x2 brick with a singular side stud. Place the
corner pieces symmetrically on top so that they create a middle 2-stud gap at the front. Then place the
1x2 brick here with the stud facing the front. Also, locate 1 light grey 2x4 tile and place it on top so all
studs are covered.
30-31. Locate a black paint roller and a 1x1 trans-yellow cylinder. Insert the longer stick into the stud of
the cylinder. Then insert the short end of the paint roller into the singular stud. You just created a light
fixture to demolish later!
32-33. Bring back your build. Place this build to the right of the door on top of the 2x4. Note that there are
no studs connecting this piece so be careful moving it. This is so we can demolish it later using the
wrecking ball! Now put this build aside carefully.
Group 18 — Number 3
34-35. Locate 1 light grey 2x4 plate and 1 tan 2x4 brick. Horizontally place the brick on top of the plate so
that they align.
36-37. Locate 1 more light grey 2x4 plate, 2 tan 2x2 corner bricks, and 1 light brown 1x2 brick with a
singular side stud. Horizontally place the 2x4 plate on top. Then place the 2x2 corner pieces
symmetrically so that they create a 1x2 gap in the front. Then place the 1x2 light brown brick there so the
stud is facing towards you.
38-39. Locate 1 light grey 2x4 tile and 1 white 2x2 circular tile with the number 3 printed on it. Use the 2x4
to tile off the top of your build then place the center of the circular tile to the side stud. Ask someone for
help to ensure the 3 is oriented correctly.
40-41. Bring back your build and place this to the left of the door on top of the 2x4 tile. Ensure that the
number 3 is facing you.
42-43. Lastly, locate 2 dark blue 2x4 slopes. Horizontally place these to the left and to the right of the
door so that overall, the entire wall has a trapezoidal shape.
Congratulations, you have completed the demolition site! Have fun destroying this with the wrecking ball
crane!
