10224 Town Hall
Welcome to text-based instructions from LEGO for the Blind. Before you start building, here are some
terms we’ll be using:
Front: towards you.
Back: away from you.
Up: towards the ceiling.
Down: towards the floor.
Stud: the bump on a Lego brick. Example: A 2x1 brick has two studs on it.
Vertically: going from front to back.
Horizontally: going from left to right.
Upright: pointing up towards the ceiling, and down towards the floor.
Symmetrically: a mirror image. Example: If you place a 2x1 brick with technic connector on the
front wall at the right, connector to the front, and then place another such piece symmetrically on
the back wall, at the right, the technic connector of the second piece should point to the back,
since it will be placed symmetrically.
There are also abbreviations defined at the end of this file.
This highly detailed model features large entranceway columns, a coat of arms, a tall bell tower with clock
and a large skylight that lets you see inside! On the ground floor, the large hall, tax office and auditorium
have everything you need to run the town. Take the working elevator up to the secretary and mayor’s
offices on the second floor, realistically furnished with desks, chairs, paintings and even a frog sculpture.
Hold a meeting and address the town’s citizens at the podium! On the third floor, a spacious meeting
room features a large conference table, chairs, globe and plants.
