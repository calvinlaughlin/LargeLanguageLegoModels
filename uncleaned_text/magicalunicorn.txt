30653 BatmanTM 1992
Set adapted by Alex Charbonneau and tested by Natalie Charbonneau.
Build the iconic superhero Batman in this polybag! Polybags are great for a quick, relaxing build, or to add
a new minifigure to your collection! This set includes the caped crusader, and a small portion of a building
for him to pose on!
This front of the polybag shows a Batman minifigure standing on the corner of a building at night. He has
a black cape billowing out behind him, and he wears a mask which covers all of his face except his
mouth. He has a yellow oval with a bat in the center on his chest, and he holds a batarang – a
boomerang shaped like the wings of a bat. Gotham CityTM stretches out behind him. A searchlight
projects a bat symbol on the low clouds over the city. The corner of the building Batman is standing on is
also made out of LEGO. It is shaped like a gargoyle head with upwards pointing fangs.
The build is 40 pieces, and 14 building steps.
Welcome to text-based instructions from Bricks for the Blind. Before you start building, here are some
terms we’ll be using:
- In Front of/Front: towards you.
- Behind/Back: away from you.
- Up: towards the ceiling.
- Down: towards the floor.
- Stud: the bump on a LEGO brick. Example: A 2x1 brick has two studs on it.
- Vertically: going from front to behind.
- Horizontally: going from left to right.
- Upright: pointing up towards the ceiling.
- That one/ppp: previously placed piece.
- Plate: piece with studs.
- Tile: smooth piece without studs (unless otherwise specified)
- Symmetrically: a mirror image. Example: If you place a 2x1 brick with technic connector on the front wall
at the right, connector to the front, and then place another such piece symmetrically on the back wall, at
the right, the technic connector of the second piece should point to the back, since it will be placed
symmetrically.
- Centered-vertically: even amount of space in front of and behind the piece
- Centered-horizontally: even amount of space left and right of the piece.
- Row: studs lined up horizontally (left to right/side to side).
- Column: studs lined up upright or vertically (top to bottom/back to front).
For builders with low vision, or a sighted building partner who may want to follow along with the printed
visual instructions that come with each kit, PDF versions are always online at LEGO.com:
(https://www.lego.com/en-us/service/buildinginstructions/30653) As low vision users may benefit
from viewing the instructions on a personal device where they can zoom in on content and use assistive
technologies to enhance the visuals.
Sorting the pieces:
To begin a successful build, it helps to sort the pieces into groups, bags or small containers. Have a
friend or family member do this in advance following the instructions below. You will see that the pieces
should be sorted according to the building steps in the kit. Doing this in advance makes locating the
pieces for each step easier. See below on how to sort the pieces to correspond to the steps in this set.
Number the containers using letters A-Z, numbers or meaningful names. The parts will be sorted into one
or a small number of steps in the instructions. Example: Steps 1-3 means collect all the parts used in
steps 1, 2 and 3, and put them in one container.
This LEGO set comes with one unlabeled bag, and an instruction booklet. Sort the pieces into groups as
described below. Note that where there are multiple colors of the same brick in a step, the colors will be
split across two groups to make telling the difference easier for the builder! LEGO includes a few spare
parts in case you lose something. Set these into their own group away from the rest, in case you need
them later.
Bag 1 (3 groups of bricks)
Minifigure group 1 contains the pieces to build the Batman minifigure, and a batarang. Ask your builder if
they’d like you to attach the head to the torso to get the alignment correct!
Main build:
Group 1 contains the pieces for steps 1-7.
Group 2 contains the pieces for steps 8-14.
Building Instructions:
Open bag 1.
Open minifigure group 1.
Assemble the Batman minifigure. Start by placing the torso onto the leg piece. The legs are black. The
torso is black with a yellow oval with a bat on the front and an orange utility belt across the waist. This belt
is where Batman keeps his many useful gadgets! The torso is printed on both the front and back. On the
back, you can see a batarang clipped to the back of the utility belt. Place the head on the stud on top of
the torso. The face has two sides; one side is a normal face and the other has a pair of white eyes above
the normal eyes. These eyes are designed to show through the holes in the Batman mask! If you have a
sighted friend helping you build, ask them to make sure the white eyes are at the front. Now place the
Batman mask with a cape on the head. Place a black batarang in Batman’s hand to complete the
minifigure!
Main Build:
Open group 1.
1.1. We’ll build the corner of a Gotham City skyscraper for Batman to stand on! The corner of the building
is decorated with a small gargoyle. Start by placing a light gray 3x3 plate in front of you.
1.2. Place a black 2x2 brick on the previous piece, even with the back right corner.
2.1. Place a light gray 1x2 inverted slope, with the slope at the front, in front of the right column of the 2x2
brick from the previous step. Place another, with the slope at the left, to the left of the back row of the 2x2
brick from the previous step.
2.2. Place a dark gray 1x1 brick to the left of the front piece from the previous step. Place another in front
of the left piece from the previous step. Now, only the front left stud of the 3x3 plate from step 1.1 should
be exposed.
3. Place a light gray 2x2 double inverted slope, with slopes at the front and the left, to the left of the front
piece from the previous step. It should be on the last remaining stud of the 3x3 plate.
4. Place a dark gray 4x4 plate on top of the build.
5.1. Place a dark gray 1x2 plate with rounded ends, horizontally long, on the rightmost two studs on the
back row of the previous piece.
5.2. Place a black 1x2 plate with a horizontal clip on one short side, with the clip at the right, in front of the
previous piece. The clip should overhang the 4x4 plate to the right.
6.1. Place a light gray 2x2 tile with two studs, with the studs at the right, in front of the previous piece.
Place another, with the studs at the back, on the left two rows of the 4x4 plate, even with the back.
6.2. Place a light gray 1x1 circular plate in front of the right stud on the left piece from the previous step.
7.1. Place a dark gray 1x1 slope tile, with the thick side at the right, in front of the 1x1 circular plate from
the previous step. Place another, with the thick side at the back, to the left of the 1x1 circular plate from
the previous step.
7.2. Attach the center hand hold of a black batarang to the clip on the right side of the build.
Open group 2.
8. Place a black 2x2 brick on the build, even with the back right corner.
9.1. Place a dark gray 1x2 masonry brick, horizontally long, in front of the 2x2 brick from the previous
step. A masonry brick has a brick wall pattern on one side, and horizontal grooves on the other side. The
side with vertical and horizontal grooves should be at the front. Place another masonry brick, vertically
long with the vertical and horizontal grooves at the left, to the left of the 2x2 brick from the previous step.
9.2. Place a dark gray 1x1 brick to the left of the front piece from the previous step.
10. Place a light gray 3x3 plate on the raised part of the build, even with the back right corner.
11. Place a dark gray 2x2 tile with a stud, on the front two rows of the previous piece, even with the left
side.
12.1. Now we’ll start the gargoyle. Place a light gray 1x1 circular plate in front of you.
12.2. Place a light gray 1x1 brick with studs on all four sides on the previous piece.
12.3. Place a light gray 1x1 circular plate on the front side stud of the previous piece.
12.4. Place a light gray 1x1 plate with a short bar on one side, with the bar on top, on the right side stud
of the 1x1 brick with studs on all four sides. Place another, symmetrically, on the left.
12.5. Attach a light gray triangle with a clip on one side to each of the bars. Attach them so one point of
the triangle is at the back, and one side of the triangle forms a vertical line at the front. Once they are
attached, hinge them so they angle towards each other. These are the wings of the gargoyle, folded up in
a resting position.
12.6. Now, attach the gargoyle to the front left stud on the main build. It should be placed at a 45 degree
angle, with the sideways 1x1 circular plate at the front left.
13.1. Now we’ll build the gargoyle’s head! Place a light gray pair of minifigure binoculars in front of you.
The binoculars are made up of two bars connected to each other. One end of each bar is thick and
hollow. This hollow end can accept a bar. There is a cutout for a stud on one side of the binoculars. Put
two silver claws, one in each hollow bar on the binoculars. These form the horns, and the binoculars form
the face of the gargoyle. The horns should curve towards the stud cutout on the binoculars.
13.2. Attach the head assembly to the main build, attaching the cutout on the binoculars to the sideways
1x1 circular plate on the front left of the building, with the horns pointing up.
14.1. Place a dark gray 1x1 slope tile, with the thick side at the left, on the front stud on the rightmost
column on top of the build. Place another, with the thick side at the front, on the leftmost stud on the back
row on top of the build.
14.2. Place a dark gray 1x2 plate with rounded ends onto the 2x2 tile with a single stud on the top of the
build. Attach it to this piece so it is centered on the piece, and is at a 45 degree angle to the rest of the
build, with a stud at the front right and back left.
15. Attach the Batman minifigure to the previous piece. He should be standing over the gargoyle and
looking to the front left.
