10211 Grand Emporium
Welcome to text-based instructions from LEGO for the Blind. Before you start building, here are some
terms we’ll be using:
Front: towards you.
Back: away from you.
Up: towards the ceiling.
Down: towards the floor.
Stud: the bump on a Lego brick. Example: A 2x1 brick has two studs on it.
Vertically: going from front to back.
Horizontally: going from left to right.
Upright: pointing up towards the ceiling, and down towards the floor.
Symmetrically: a mirror image. Example: If you place a 2x1 brick with technic connector on the
front wall at the right, connector to the front, and then place another such piece symmetrically on
the back wall, at the right, the technic connector of the second piece should point to the back,
since it will be placed symmetrically.
There are also abbreviations defined at the end of this file.
The LEGO® Modular Buildings series continues with this spectacularly detailed 3-story department store,
designed in a realistic scale with lots of special building techniques and rare pieces. On the street outside,
citizens carry shopping bags, send letters at the mailbox, admire the window mannequins, then cool off at
the ice cream stand while a busy window washer works above. Enter through the revolving doors to
discover a ground-floor clothing department, complete with a cash register, fitting room, hats, jewelry,
perfume, and even a selection of spare trousers. A brick-built escalator carries customers to the secondfloor housewares department with glassware and golden plates for special occasions, and then it’s up to
the top floor for the toy department (complete with toy house and push-scooter) with an impressive
chandelier above the open atrium. Up on the roof are a billboard and skylight!
People bag. Make the people.
Start the emporium!
Bag 1 (items 1-2 in book)
Take a 32x32 square base. We’ll call the top-to-bottom dot lines columns and the left-to-right dot lines
rows.
Make a border along the front and the left sides using 3 1x1 flat smooth pieces for the corners and 10 6x1
flat smooth pieces for the sides
Make the border wider. Put a 2x1 flat smooth piece in the second column of the base, in the left end
furthest from you (on top).
Put a 2x2 flat piece next to it, along the first column of the border.
Put a 2x1 flat smooth piece next to it.
Put a 2x1 grate piece next to it.
Put a 2x2 flat piece next.
Put 4 2x1 flat smooth pieces next.
A grate.
4 2x1 smooth flat pieces.
A 1x1 flat smooth piece in the inner corner.
4 2x1 flat smooth pieces along the front side (second row).
A grate.
4 more 2x1 flat smooth pieces.
Then leave a 2-dot gap.

for the right side vertical 6x1 piece on the column 16. There one 2x1 piece goes vertically next and to the
left of the 6x1 piece, on the bottom, the other one on the top, and the third one goes horizontally in the
middle, protruding one dot to the left.
