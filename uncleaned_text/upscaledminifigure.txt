40649 Up-Scaled Minifigure
Adapted by John Le and tested by Matthew Shifrin
Enchant any LEGO® enthusiast aged 10 and up with this buildable Up-Scaled LEGO Minifigure (40649).
This posable minifigure looks just like the one found in front of the LEGO Campus in Billund and has a
movable head, arms, legs, and hands. It also features an opening hat that hides a standard-size
minifigure inside to inspire role-play fun. This up-scaled buildable figure will look great in any home or
office and makes a meaningful gift for any fan of LEGO buildings or minifigures.
Keepsake with a secret – In addition to a movable head, hands, arms, and legs, this up-scaled minifigure
has a hat that opens to reveal a standard-sized minifigure inside, ideal for role-play fun.
Measurements – This fun, posable minifigure stands over 10.5 in. (27 cm) tall, and makes an appealing
piece for display anywhere.
The front of the box shows the Up-Scale Minifigure standing next to a regular-sized minifigure. They both
have on a red torso, blue legs, yellow head, and a blue hat.
The back of the box shows the Up-Scaled Minifigure sitting down. There is a smaller picture that shows
that the head can rotate, the arms can move forward and backward, the hands can rotate, and how the
legs can move. There is one more picture that shows how the cap can open revealing the regular-sized
minifigure controlling the Up-Scaled Minifigure.
The build is 654 pieces in total, 204 steps, and is for ages 10+.
There are 3 bags labeled 1 that have the pieces for the red torso, 2 bags labeled 2 that have the pieces
for the blue legs, bag 3 has the pieces for the hands and arms, bag 4 has the pieces for the head, and
bag 5 has the pieces for the hat and minifigure.
Welcome to text-based instructions from LEGO for the Blind. Before you start building, here are some
terms we may be using:
- In Front of/Front: towards you.
- Behind/Back: away from you.
- Up: towards the ceiling.
- Down: towards the floor.
- Stud: the bump on a LEGO brick. Example: A 2x1 brick has two studs on it.
- Vertically: going from front to behind.
- Horizontally: going from left to right.
- Upright: pointing up towards the ceiling.
- That one/ppp: previously placed piece.
- Plate: piece with studs.
- Tile: smooth piece without studs (unless otherwise specified)
- Symmetrically: a mirror image. Example: If you place a 2x1 brick with technic
connector on the front wall at the right, connector to the front, and then place another
such piece symmetrically on the back wall, at the right, the technic connector of the
second piece should point to the back, since it will be placed symmetrically.
- Centered-vertically: even amount of space in front of and behind piece.
- Centered-horizontally: even amount of space left and right of piece.
- Row: studs lined up from left to right.
- Column: studs lined up from top to bottom or back to front.
For builders with low vision, or a sighted building partner may want to follow along with the printed visual
instructions that come with each kit, or PDF versions are always online at LEGO.com for each set:
(https://www.lego.com/en-us/service/buildinginstructions/40649) As low vision users may benefit from
viewing the instructions on a personal device where they can zoom in on content and use assistive
technologies to enhance the visuals.
Sorting the pieces:
To begin a successful build, it helps to sort the pieces into groups, bags, or small containers. Have a
friend or family member do this in advance following the instructions below. You will see that the pieces
should be sorted according to the building steps in the kit. Doing this in advance makes locating the
pieces for each step easier. See below on how to sort the pieces to correspond to the steps in this set.
Number the containers using letters A-Z, numbers, or meaningful names. The parts will be sorted into one
or a small number of steps in the instructions. Example: Steps 1-3 means collect all the parts used in
steps 1,2 and 3, and put them in one container.
This LEGO set comes with 3 bags labeled 1, 2 bags labeled 2, 1 bag labeled 3, 1 bag labeled 4, 1 bag
labeled 5, 1 set of instructions, and 1 loose dome piece. Sort the pieces into groups or piles as described
below. Note that where there are multiple colors of the same brick in a step, the colors will be split into 2
groups to make telling the difference easier for the builder! LEGO includes a few spare parts in case you
lose something. Set these into their own group away from the rest, in case you need them later.

Let’s get to building!
Warning! This set is difficult to build. Be very careful when handling the various assemblies when
connecting them and lots of patience is needed when building this set! Do not press too hard on
assemblies if you don't think they're connecting properly, otherwise everything will implode and pieces will
fly everywhere.
Building Instructions (Bags 1):
Group 1 — Back of Torso:
1. Locate 1 red 1x4 plate and 1 red 1x6 brick. With your plate horizontally placed, horizontally place your
brick on top of it so that it overhangs 1 stud on the left and right.
2. Locate 2 red 1x6 plates. Vertically place the back stud of each plate underneath the overhang of the
1x6 brick.
3. Locate 2 red 1x10 bricks. Vertically place on top of the left and right so that the back side is touching
the 1x6 brick. There should be a 1x5 overhang in the front on both pieces.
4. Locate 2 red 1x6 plates. Vertically place each plate underneath the overhang of each PPP so that the
front stud of each plate is visible.
5. Locate 1 red 1x6 brick and 1 red 1x4 plate. With your plate horizontally placed, horizontally place your
brick on top of it so that it overhangs 1 stud on the left and right. Then horizontally place this build in the
front so that the overhang sits on the 2 visible studs from plates from step 4. You should now end up with
a rectangular frame. Keep the build vertical.
6. Locate 4 red 2x2 plates and 2 red 1x2 slope tiles. Place each of the 2x2 plates in the corners so that
they overhang 1 stud inside the rectangle. Then symmetrically and horizontally place your slope tiles in
the front and back gaps created by the 2 red 2x2 plates. Make sure that the slopes are going down
toward the center of the rectangle.
7. Locate 2 red 1x4 plates and 2 red 2x6 plates. Horizontally place 1 red 2x6 plate behind the front 2x2
plates so that the left and right ends sit on top of the brick. Then do the same for the other 2x6 plate but in
front of the back 2x2 plates. Now vertically place your 1x4 plates in between the 2x6 plates on the left and
right sides
8. Locate 2 red 2x6 bricks and 4 red 1x2 grill slope tiles that run vertically. Vertically place your 2 grill
slopes in the back to the left and right of the 1x2 slope tile so that the slopes run down from back to front.
Then vertically place your remaining 2 grill slopes in the front to the left and right of the 1x2 slope tile so
that the slopes run down from front to back. Then orient your build so it is horizontal. Then horizontally
place your 2x6 bricks in the front and back so that there is no overhang and that there is a free column of
studs on the left and right between these bricks and the slopes that you just placed.
9. Locate 4 tall red 1x2 slopes. Vertically place 2 to the left and right of the back 2x6 brick so that the
slope goes down from back to front. Then in the back left and right corners, horizontally place your
remaining 2 slopes so that they go down outwards. Doing this should create 2 1x2 studded areas on top
of the slopes.
10. Locate 2 more tall red 1x2 slopes. Horizontally place these on top of the 2 1x2 studded areas on top
of the previously placed slopes. Make sure they go down outwards. Then locate 1 red 1x6 tall panel.
Horizontally place this in the back gap created by the slopes so that the outer wall is facing back.
Group 2 — Inner Mechanism:
11. Put your main build aside for now. Then locate 1 red 1x4 brick with 3 holes, and 1 teal 1x2 plate.
Place down your red brick horizontally and then horizontally place your teal plate on top of this brick in the
middle.
12. Locate 1 light grey 1x2 brick with a cross-hole and 1 more teal 1x2 plate. Horizontally place the 1x2
brick on top of the teal plate that is on the 1x4 brick. Then horizontally place your teal 1x2 plate on top of
this brick.
13. Locate 1 white 1x4 plate with inverted slopes, 1 tan 1x2 brick with 2 holes, and 2 purple 1x1 circular
plates. Horizontally place your white 1x4 plate with inverted slopes on top of the teal 1x2 plate placed in 
the previous step. Make sure that only the inverted slopes are overhanging on the left and right. Then in
the gap of the white 1x4 plate with inverted slopes, horizontally place your tan 1x2 brick. Now place your
1x1 circular plates to the left and right of this brick so that they sit on top of the inverted slopes. Put this
sub-build aside for now.
Note for steps 14-23, you will be doing these steps twice to make two pieces that hold the arms so do
them twice as you go through these steps.
14. Locate 1 red 1x4 brick with 3 holes and 1 red 2x2 plate. Place down your 1x4 brick horizontally and
then place the 2x2 plate on top of the right side of the brick so that it overhangs in the front.
15. Locate 1 more red 1x4 brick with 3 holes. Horizontally place this under the overhang so that the left
side of this brick aligns with the left side of the other brick.
16. Locate 1 more red 2x2 plate. Place this on the left side on top of the exposed 4 studs of the 2 bricks.
17. Locate 1 black 1x6 technic axle and 1 dark grey technic gear. With the axle vertically placed, insert
the technic gear into the front side of the axle and push it in so all of the gear is in the axle but not too
much so that the axle pokes out. Then with the axle oriented the same way, insert it through the middle
front-facing hole.
18. Locate 2 dark grey 1x3 pegs with a longer circular side and a shorter cross side, and 2 more dark
grey gears. Insert each gear into each of the cross sides of the pegs. Make sure to push the gears in all
the way! Then insert the circular side of the pegs into the left and right holes of the front-facing side. The
gears should fit tightly and hold the middle gear into place so that it doesn’t slip out.
19. Locate 2 red 1x1 plates and 1 light grey 2x4 plate with a 2x2 studded side and a 2x2 flat side with a
hole overhanging. Vertically place the 2x4 plate on top of the build, starting at the back with tube to the
front right. Then in the back, to the left and right of this plate, place your 1x1 plates.
20. Locate 1 white 1x2 brick a singular hole and 1 teal 1x2 plate. Horizontally place your 1x2 plate on top
of the horizontal 1x2 brick so that there is no overhang. Then place this part in the front under the flat side
and hole overhang of the 2x4 plate. Make sure there are no studs of the teal 1x2 plate exposed.
21. Locate 1 red 1x4 plate, 1 red 1x4 tile, and 1 tall 1x4 panel. Horizontally place your 1x4 plate on top of
the back 4 studs of the build. Then horizontally place your tile on top of this plate. Then horizontally place
your tall 1x4 panel on your surface so that the outer wall is facing the back. Then with your build oriented
the same way, place the back of the bottom on top of the 4 studs of the panel. Make sure there is no
overhang. Put this aside for now. We will call this the arm holder.
Group 3 — Inner Mechanism:
22.1-22.2. Locate 1 bright green 2x4 plate and 2 tan 1x2 bricks with 2 holes. Horizontally place your 2 tan
bricks in the back row on the left and front row on the right.
22.3. Now locate 1 orange 2x2 plate and 1 teal 1x2 plate. Place your 2x2 plate on top of the previously
placed bricks. Then vertically place your 1x2 plate on top of this plate on the left.
22.4. Locate 2 black 1x2 pegs. Place these in the holes located in the front right and back right.
22.5. Now locate 1 red 2x3 stair plate. Place this under the left side of the 2x4 bright green plate so that
the 2x2 upper stud area is attached to the bottom of the plate, and the 1x2 lower stud area is exposed on
the left.
22.6. Now orient this build so that the 2 exposed studs of the stair plate are facing back. Bring back the
arm holder build and orient it so the axle is facing back. Then place the bottom of this piece on top of the
2 exposed studs so that it overhangs on the left and right. The 1x2 panel should mount on top of the 2x1
step with the outer wall of the panel to the back. The 1x2 white brick with a hole in the front of the arm
holder build should click into place with the teal 1x2 plate that is on top of the orange 2x2 plate.
23. Locate 1 orange 1x3 peg with a cross hole and 1 blue 1x2 peg with a circular side and cross side.
Orient your 1x3 peg horizontally so that the cross hole is on the left. Insert it into the side hole on the 2x4
plate at the front top of the build. Make sure you insert the peg from left to right so that the cross hole is
facing left. Then insert the cross side of the blue 1x2 peg into the cross hole. Congratulations, you
finished the arm holder build!
Now, if you haven’t done it already, repeat steps 14-23 so you have two of these arm holder builds.
24. Bring back your sub build now, which is the inner mechanism you just made, and make sure it is
horizontal. Orient 1 of your arm holder builds so that the axle is facing right. Insert the back pegs of this
build into the higher right and lower right holes of the sub-build. Then orient your other arm holder build so
that the axle is facing left. Insert the two back pegs of this build into the higher left and lower left holes of
the sub-build. We will call this the arm mechanism now! Put this aside while we build the front side that
holds it in place.
25.1. Locate 1 red 1x4 brick with 3 holes, and 1 teal 1x2 plate. Place down your red brick horizontally and
then horizontally place your teal plate on top of this brick in the middle.
25.2. Locate 1 light grey 1x2 brick with a cross-hole and 1 more teal 1x2 plate. Horizontally place the 1x2
brick on top of the teal plate that is on the 1x4 brick. Then horizontally place your teal 1x2 plate on top of
this brick.
25.3. Locate 1 white 1x4 plate with inverted slopes, 1 tan 1x2 brick with 2 holes, and 2 purple 1x1 circular
plates. Horizontally place your white 1x4 plate with inverted slopes on top of the teal 1x2 plate placed in
the previous step. Make sure that only the inverted slopes are overhanging on the left and right. Then in
the gap of the white 1x4 plate with inverted slopes, horizontally place your tan 1x2 brick. Now place your
1x1 circular plates to the left and right of this brick so that they sit on top of the inverted slopes.
25.4. Flip your arm mechanism on its side so that there are 2 studs in the front and 2 studs in the back
facing up. Place the build you just made on top of the pegs so that the front 2 pegs fit into place with the
outer holes of the 1x4 brick. The back 2 pegs should fit into place with the 2 holes on the tan 1x2 brick.
26. Locate 1 black 1x4 bar. With your build still flipped on its side, insert this bar into the hole shaped like
a cross located in the middle of the build.
27. Bring back your main build now and orient it so the tall side is in the back. Then flip your arm
mechanism build so it is now upright and horizontal. Place this on top of the main build in front of the back
wall. The front and back 1x4 bricks with holes located at the bottom of the arm mechanism build should 
click into place with the 2 red 2x6 bricks. There should be an exposed stud of the 2x6 brick to the left and
to the right of the 1x4 brick with holes, and the front 6 studs of this brick should be exposed as well. Now
put this main build aside for now while we build the platform where the head will sit.
Group 4 — Platform for Shoulders:
28.1-28.2. Locate 4 light green 2x2 plates with side studs. Push them together so that 4 side studs are
facing front and 4 side studs are facing back. Doing this should create a horizontal 2x4 stud gap. Locate 1
bright green 2x4 plate. Horizontally place this in the gap so there is no overhang.
28.3. Note that this piece is not in group 4. It is located in group 5. Locate 1 black 2x4 plate with holes
between the studs. Vertically place this plate down the middle of the top of the build. Then locate 2
orange 1x4 plates. Vertically place them to the left and right of the previously placed 2x4 plate with holes.
28.4. Locate 4 red 1x2 plates with 4 side studs. Horizontally place 2 on the front-facing side and 2 on the
back-facing side so that the studs of each plate are facing up. There should be no overhang on the left
and right of these plates.
28.5. Bring back your main build now and make sure it is still horizontal so that the axles for the arms are
facing left and right. Orient the platform for the head you just made so that it is horizontal and the side
studs are on the left and right. Then place this build on top of the build in the gap so that it sits on top of 2
tan 1x2 bricks with 2 holes. There should be no overhang in the front, and the left and right sides of the
1x2 plates with 4 studs should align with the left and right sides.
Group 5 — Front of Torso and Head Platform:
29. Locate 4 tall red 1x2 slopes. In the front, vertically place two of the slopes on the left and right of the
red 2x6 brick so that the slopes are facing into the build. Then symmetrically and horizontally place your
other 2 slopes on the front left and front right corners so that the slopes align with the sides of the build.
There should now be a 1x2 stud area on the top of the slopes in the front left and right.
30. Locate 2 more tall red 1x2 slopes and 1 tall red 1x6 panel. Horizontally and symmetrically place the
slopes on top of the 1x2 studded areas created by the previously placed slopes. Make sure that the
slopes align with the left and right sides of the build. Then horizontally place your panel in the gap
between the slopes so that the outer wall is facing the front.
31. Locate 2 red 2x6 tiles and 2 red 1x4 tiles. Vertically and symmetrically place your 2x6 tiles on top of
the build on the left and right. Then horizontally place your 1x4 tiles in the front and back gaps created by
the 2x6 tiles.
32. Locate 1 black 4x4 tile with a circular shape on top. Place this in the middle gap on top of the build.
33. Locate 1 black 4x4 circular brick and 1 black cross-shaped peg. Place the circular brick on top of the
circular shape of the 4x4 tile. Insert your peg into the middle hole of the brick.
34. Locate 1 white 2x2 tile. Place this on top of the circular brick on the 4 studs that surround the middle
hole.
Group 6 — Leg Mechanism:
35. Put your main build aside for now while we build the part that holds the legs! Locate 1 blue 2x2 plate.
36. Locate 2 light grey 1x2 bricks with cross-shaped holes. Vertically place them on top of the plate so
there is no overhang.
37. Locate 1 long yellow 1x9 axle and 1 light green 2x2 brick. Insert the axle through the cross-shaped
holes so that the build sits in the middle of the axle. Then place your 2x2 brick on top of previously placed
pieces.
38. Locate 2 bright green 1x2 plates with 4 side studs. Make sure the axle is running left to right. Then
horizontally place your 1x2 plates with side studs in the front and back so there are 4 studs facing front,
and 4 studs facing back.
39. Locate 1 more light green 2x2 brick. Place this on top of the previously placed pieces.
40. Locate 2 red 2x3 stair plates. Symmetrically and horizontally place these on top of the brick on the left
and right. There should now be a 2x2 stud area on the left and on the right and a 2x2 stud gap between
them.
41. Locate 2 more bright green 1x2 plates with 4 side studs. Horizontally place these in the front and back
gap so that there are 4 more studs facing the front and 4 more studs facing the back.
42. Locate 1 more light green 2x2 brick. Place this in the 2x2 gap on top of the previously placed plates.
43. Make a part! Locate 1 white 2x8 plate and 2 black 2x4 plates with raised sides. With your 2x8
horizontal, symmetrically and vertically place the gaps of the 2x4 plates underneath the 2x8 plate on the
left and right sides. Then with this white 2x8 plate, place it on top of the 2x2 light green brick placed in
step 42 so that it sits in the middle. The bottom of the 2x4 plates with raised sides should click into place
with 2 studs from the stair plates that are underneath them.
44. Locate 2 yellow 1x2 plates with 8 side studs, and 2 teal 1x2 plates. On the 8 side studs of this plate,
vertically place 2 of the 1x2 plates on the left and right side so there is no overhang. Repeat this again so
you end up with 2 of these structures. Then horizontally and symmetrically place them in the front and
back of the white 2x8 plate. They should fit into place between the 2 black 2x4 plates with raised sides.
45. Flip your build upside down so that the bottom is now facing up. Make sure it is still horizontal so that
the axle is running left to right. Then locate 1 blue 2x2 plate, 1 blue 2x2 circular plate with a smooth side,
and 2 bright green 1x2 plates with 4 side studs. Place the 2x2 plate upside down on your surface. Then
vertically place your 1x2 plates with side studs upside down on top of this 2x2 plate so that the side studs
are facing left and right. Then place your 2x2 circular plate with a smooth side upside down in the gap
created by the side studs. Then flip this structure so the studs of the 2x2 plate are facing up. Then insert
this structure on top of your build so that the side studs are in the front and back. Note that this won’t
connect in any way, we will do that later.
Group 7 — Leg Mechanism:
46. Locate 2 light green 2x8 plates. With your build still upside down and horizontal, vertically place your
2x8 plates on the front and back so that they cover all the side studs. 
47. Locate 2 purple 2x4 tiles. Horizontally place these on the lower frontside and lower backside so that
they cover the horizontal 2x4 stud areas.
48. Locate 2 blue 1x2 plates with 2x2 tile attached on the side. Horizontally place these in the front and
back above the purple 2x4 tiles so that the 2x2 tile part attaches to the studs of the 2x8 plates and make
sure that the 1x2 stud part is facing up.
49. Locate 4 dark grey 2x3 technic pieces with a cross-shaped hole and a ball clip, and 4 black balls with
a cross hole. Place the 2x3 technic piece flat on the table so that the cross-shaped hole is facing up and
on the right. Then push your ball into the ball clip on the left side and orient it so the cross-shaped hole is
facing up. Repeat this for the rest of them. Then insert the holes in 2 of the balls attached to the technic
pieces through the axis on the left side. Make sure the axle is through the ball and not the technic piece.
Then orient the technic piece so that the hole part of it is upright and facing left. Repeat the same with the
other 2 balls connected to the technic pieces but now using the right side of the axle.
50. Then locate 2 red 1x4 axle. Insert these into the holes of the technic pieces and make sure to push
them all the way in so they are through both technic pieces. Then put this sub-build aside for now.
Group 8 — Leg Mechanism:
51. Locate 1 blue 2x6 plate. Place it horizontally in front of you.
52. Locate 2 blue 1x6 plates. Vertically place the back side on top of the 2x6 plate on the left and right
sides so that the 4 studs overhang to the front.
53. Locate 2 blue 1x8 plates. Vertically insert these underneath the overhang of the PPPs so that there
are 4 visible studs of each of these plates in the front.
54. Locate 2 blue 1x6 plates. Vertically place these on top of the PPPs so that they overhang 2 studs in
the front.
55. Locate 1 blue 2x6 plate. Horizontally insert it underneath the overhang so that the overhang sits on
the left and right of this plate.
56. Locate 4 blue 1x3 curves. Horizontally place 1 in the front left and 1 in the back left corners so that
there is no overhang and that they go down from left to right. Then place 1 in the front right corner and 1
in the back right corner so the ones on the front and back left curves to the right, and the ones on the
front right and back right curves to the left.
57. Locate 4 blue 1x4 plates. In front of the back 2 curves on the left and right sides, vertically place your
2 blue 1x4 plates. Then behind the front 2 curves on the left and right sides, vertically place your
remaining 2 plates. You should end up with a vertical 1x2 stud gap on the left and right sides.
58. Locate 4 blue 1x2 tiles. Behind the front 2 curves on top of the previously placed plates, vertically
place your 1x2 tiles. Then in front of the 2 back curves on top of the previously placed plates, vertically
place your 2 tiles. On the middle of the left and right sides, there should be 6 exposed studs on each side
between the tiles.
59. Bring back your sub-build and orient it so that it is horizontal and the large platform side is facing up.
Then flip the build you were working on upside down so it is horizontal and the studs are facing down
now. And insert the rectangular frame through the platform and click the 2 studs in the front and back

Group 36 — Radar:
201.2. Locate 1 dark grey 1x2 slope tile with a green radar printed on it. Vertically place this on top of the
2x2 brick with ridges located on the left side so that the slope is facing right.
Group 37 — Buttons:
201.3. Locate 1 dark grey 1x2 slope tile with red and grey buttons printed on it. Vertically place this on top
of the 2x2 brick with ridges located on the right side so that the slope is facing left.
Group 38. — Handlebars and Dome
202. Locate 2 blue 1x2 bar holders. These pieces have a hole that fits a bar and a handlebar at the top.
Then locate 2 red 1x1 circular plates with a bar attached. Insert the bar end of each red circular plate into
the holes of the bar holders. Lay the circular plates down so it is in the front and the stud is facing up.
Now feel the top of the bar holders and make sure that they are smooth with no ridges from the 
handlebars. If they are not, rotate them until they are. Then insert the bottom of the circular plate onto the
left and right pegs located in the hole of the 1x2 yellow plate in the front. Then rotate the handlebars so
they are not overhanging in the front of the build.
203. Bring back the hat build and make sure there is a row of 4 studs facing up. Now orient your driver
cockpit so the gears are to the left, then place it so that the middle of the bottom sits on top of the 4 studs
and is towards the back of the hat. You can check if it is placed correctly in the next step.
204. Locate your large blue dome piece. Find the 2 hinge connectors and attach them to the 2 hinges in
the back of the hat. Make sure the inside of the hat is facing you. Now slowly lower the dome until it either
fits perfectly or comes into contact with your driver cockpit. If it does come into contact with your cockpit,
first check if it is horizontally centered by making sure there is an even amount of space on the left and
right. After you did this and it is correctly centered, move your cockpit back 1 stud and test if the dome fits.
Do this until your dome fits perfectly on the hat.
205. Bring back your hatless Up-Scaled Minifigure and put on his hat so the longer part is in the front.
Congratulations, you have finished the Up-Scaled Minifigure! Now grab your small minifigure and sit him
down in the cockpit! Orient his hands so he is driving the big minifigure! You might have to move the
handlebars to fit your driver!
The last 2 pages have a list of all the parts used!
Congratulations again on completing your Up-Scaled Minifigure!
