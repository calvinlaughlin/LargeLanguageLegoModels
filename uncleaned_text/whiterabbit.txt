Set adapted by Alex Charbonneau and tested by Natalie Charbonneau.
Kids aged 8 and up can play out fun stories with this fantastic LEGO® Creator 3in1 White Rabbit (31133)
playset. It features a brick-built toy bunny with a posable head, legs, mouth and ears, and it comes with a
choice of 2 snacks: a carrot or a flower.
Nonstop imaginative play for animal lovers
- There are 3 different build-and-play experiences for kids to enjoy with this LEGO Creator 3in1 set. They
can build a toy bunny and then rebuild it into a beautiful cockatoo parrot eating seeds, or an adorable
white seal with a fish snack.
Posable animals:
- The rabbit can move its head, legs, mouth and ears; the cockatoo parrot can move its wings, tail and
neck and rotate its head 360 degrees; and the seal can move its mouth and flippers.
Packed with accessories:
- The toy rabbit comes with a carrot and a flower, the cockatoo parrot can ‘eat’ seeds, and the seal has a
fish that can be attached to its mouth.
A fun build:
- This 258-piece building set lets kids aged 8 and up enjoy an exciting building experience and is the
perfect reward for passionate LEGO® fans
Play on the go:
- The toy rabbit stands over 5.5 in. (15 cm) high, making it a portable size for kids to take wherever they
go.
The box is yellow. On the front of the box is an image of the white rabbit, standing on all fours next to a
carrot and a yellow flower. The rabbit is completely white, except for the inside of the ears which are pink.
There is a small inset image of a white cockatoo with yellow head feathers, and another of a white seal
sitting next to a fish.
The top of the box shows a life sized image of a green 1x1 circular plate with three leaves. There are also
small images of each of the three builds included in the set. The rabbit stands next to a carrot. The
cockatoo stands next to two brown plates which represent treats, and the seal playfully rolls on its back
as it holds the fish over its mouth.
The back of the box shows the three builds again. The rabbit is shown posing with its ears laying flat next
to the carrot and flower. The cockatoo is shown perched on a computer generated branch. The seal is
shown in a swimming pose on a blue background.
The rabbit build is 258 pieces, and 102 building steps. The cockatoo build is 173 pieces and 74 building
steps. The seal is 161 pieces and 59 steps.
Welcome to text-based instructions from Bricks for the Blind. Before you start building, here are some
terms we’ll be using:
- In Front of/Front: towards you.
- Behind/Back: away from you.
- Up: towards the ceiling.
- Down: towards the floor.
- Stud: the bump on a LEGO brick. Example: A 2x1 brick has two studs on it.
- Vertically: going from front to behind.
- Horizontally: going from left to right.
- Upright: pointing up towards the ceiling.
- That one/ppp: previously placed piece.
- Plate: piece with studs.
- Tile: smooth piece without studs (unless otherwise specified)
- Symmetrically: a mirror image. Example: If you place a 2x1 brick with technic connector on the front wall
at the right, connector to the front, and then place another such piece symmetrically on the back wall, at
the right, the technic connector of the second piece should point to the back, since it will be placed
symmetrically.
- Centered-vertically: even amount of space in front of and behind the piece
- Centered-horizontally: even amount of space left and right of the piece.
- Row: studs lined up horizontally (left to right/side to side).
- Column: studs lined up upright or vertically (top to bottom/back to front).
For builders with low vision, or a sighted building partner who may want to follow along with the printed
visual instructions that come with each kit, PDF versions are always online at LEGO.com:
(https://www.lego.com/en-us/service/buildinginstructions/31133) As low vision users may benefit
from viewing the instructions on a personal device where they can zoom in on content and use assistive
technologies to enhance the visuals.
Sorting the pieces:
To begin a successful build, it helps to sort the pieces into groups, bags or small containers. Have a
friend or family member do this in advance following the instructions below. You will see that the pieces
should be sorted according to the building steps in the kit. Doing this in advance makes locating the
pieces for each step easier. See below on how to sort the pieces to correspond to the steps in this set.
Number the containers using letters A-Z, numbers or meaningful names. The parts will be sorted into one
or a small number of steps in the instructions. Example: Steps 1-3 means collect all the parts used in
steps 1, 2 and 3, and put them in one container.
This LEGO set comes with two unlabeled bags and an instruction booklet. Sort the pieces into groups as
described below. Note that where there are multiple colors of the same brick in a step, the colors will be
split across two groups to make telling the difference easier for the builder! LEGO includes a few spare
parts in case you lose something. Set these into their own group away from the rest, in case you need
them later.
