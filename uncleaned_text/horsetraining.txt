§
Welcome to text-based instructions from Bricks for the Blind. Before you start building, here are some
terms we’ll be using:
- In Front of/Front: towards you.
- Behind/Back: away from you.
- Up: towards the ceiling.
- Down: towards the floor.
- Stud: the bump on a LEGO brick. Example: A 2x1 brick has two studs on it.
- Vertically: going from front to behind.
- Horizontally: going from left to right.
- Upright: pointing up towards the ceiling.
- That one/ppp: previously placed piece.
- Plate: piece with studs.
- Tile: smooth piece without studs (unless otherwise specified)
- Symmetrically: a mirror image. Example: If you place a 2x1 brick with technic connector on the front wall
at the right, connector to the front, and then place another such piece symmetrically on the back wall, at
the right, the technic connector of the second piece should point to the back, since it will be placed
symmetrically.
- Centered-vertically: even amount of space in front of and behind the piece
- Centered-horizontally: even amount of space left and right of the piece.
- Row: studs lined up horizontally (left to right/side to side).
- Column: studs lined up upright or vertically (top to bottom/back to front).
For builders with low vision, or a sighted building partner who may want to follow along with the printed
visual instructions that come with each kit, PDF versions are always online at LEGO.com:
(https://www.lego.com/en-us/service/buildinginstructions/41746) As low vision users may benefit
from viewing the instructions on a personal device where they can zoom in on content and use assistive
technologies to enhance the visuals.
§
Sorting the pieces:
To begin a successful build, it helps to sort the pieces into groups, bags or small containers. Have a
friend or family member do this in advance following the instructions below. You will see that the pieces
should be sorted according to the building steps in the kit. Doing this in advance makes locating the
pieces for each step easier. See below on how to sort the pieces to correspond to the steps in this set.
Number the containers using letters A-Z, numbers or meaningful names. The parts will be sorted into one
or a small number of steps in the instructions. Example: Steps 1-3 means collect all the parts used in
steps 1, 2 and 3, and put them in one container.
This LEGO set comes with three bags labeled 1-3, an unlabeled bag with large parts, and three
instruction booklets labeled 1-3. Sort the pieces into groups as described below. Note that where there
are multiple colors of the same brick in a step, the colors will be split across two groups to make telling
the difference easier for the builder! LEGO includes a few spare parts in case you lose something. Set
these into their own group away from the rest, in case you need them later.
A note for helpers: this set does not have numbered steps. I’ll use the page numbers to identify which
pieces go in which groups for sorting! I’ll make numbered steps in the instructions, with the corresponding
page in parenthesis.

Building Instructions:
Open bag 1.
Open minifigure group 1.
Assemble the Aliya minifigure by placing the torso on the legs, the head on the torso, and the helmet on
top of the head. The chin is slightly pointed and goes on the front of the minifigure. Assemble a carrot by
placing a green bar with two leaves into the hole on the thick end of a carrot. Place the carrot into one of
Aliya’s hands.
Open group 1.
Sub-build 1: Wheelbarrow
1. (Pages 8 & 9) Let’s start by building a wheelbarrow to take food to the horses! Place a green
wheelbarrow body in front of you, with the handles at the left. Clip a pair of small wheels into the clips on

of hay for hungry horses!
3. (Pages 8 & 9) Place a red apple to the right of the previous piece.
Sub-build 2: Activity Wheel
4. (Pages 10 & 11) Now we’ll build an activity wheel. You can spin the wheel to tell you what you should
do next! There are three symbols, a pillow, a brush, and a carrot, showing when it’s time to sleep, cleanup, or eat! We’ll make the stand first. Start by placing a tan 4x4 circular plate in front of you.

bottom and there is a point at the top.
10. (Pages 16 & 17) Place a light gray 1x2 brick with a pin on one side, with the pin on the front, on the
top of the build. Now the stand is complete.
11. (Pages 18 & 19) Start the wheel itself by placing a white 4x4 circular brick in front of you. Notice there
is a hole which goes all the way through the center of this piece. We’ll use this hole to attach the wheel to
the stand later on.
12. (Pages 18 & 19) Place a white 4x4 dish on the previous piece. This dish is printed with three equal
segments: a brush, a pillow, and a carrot.
13. (Pages 20 & 21) Rotate the wheel so the dish is at the front and attach it to the pin on the stand. The
pin goes into the center hole on the 4x4 circular brick.
Open group 2.
Sub-build 3: Viewing Platform
14. (Pages 22 & 23) Now we’ll start building the viewing platform which goes on top of the stables. From
here, people can watch the horses and riders! Start by placing a tan 6x6 plate with one rounded end, with
the rounded end at the front, in front of you.
15. (Pages 22 & 23) Place a white 2x4 tile with two studs, horizontally long and centered horizontally, on
the second and third rows from the back on the previous piece.

studs on the front and centered horizontally, on the front studs of the two pieces from the previous step.
19. (Pages 26 & 27) Place a white 1x2 plate with an upwards bar on one long side, with the bar on the
left, on the back two studs of the left straight fence panel. Place another symmetrically on the right fence
panel.
20. (Pages 28 & 29) Now we’ll make a bench. Place a white 2x4 plate with an inverted slope on each
end, horizontally long, in front of you.
21. (Pages 28 & 29) Place a teal 2x4 tile, horizontally long and centered vertically and horizontally, on the
previous piece.

studs at the front of the platform. This piece is printed with a purple circle, ringed by dark purple. In the
center of the circle is a golden horse rearing on its hind legs. At the bottom of the circle is a golden
horseshoe, with its prongs pointing up so it looks like a letter U.
26. (Pages 34 & 35) Now we’ll make a binocular stand. Place a gold telescope, with the stud on top, on
the middle stud of the left curved fence piece. This is just to the left of the 3x3 circular tile.
27. (Pages 34 & 35) Place a pair of dark gray binoculars, with the thick side pointing to the front left, on
the previous piece. There is a cutout for a stud on one side of the binoculars, use this to attach them to
the telescope.
Open Bag 2
Open minifigure group 2:
Assemble the Mia minifigure by placing the torso on the legs, the head on the torso, and the hair on top of
the head. The chin is slightly pointed and goes on the front of the minifigure. Place the foal figure next to
Mia.
Main Build: Stables
Open group 3. This includes the large base piece. There are two 2x4 plates stacked together, leave them
together for now. The top one is light blue and the bottom one is purple.
