10246 Detective’s Office
Discover a world of mystery and adventure with the LEGO® Creator Expert Detective’s Office! Step
through the open archway and into the barbershop, where seated customers are pampered in the
reflection of a large wall mirror, while next door, competitors play pool and darts beneath the comforting
whir of a rotating ceiling fan. Venture to the first floor and you’ll find the detective’s office, his desk
strewn with clues, a safe containing valuable evidence and a concealed wall compartment. Then visit
the adjacent bathroom, featuring a classic pull-chain toilet, before taking the stairway to the wellequipped kitchen, from where you can access the roof terrace, complete with large water tower. This
latest addition to the LEGO Modular Building series is packed with unsurpassed detail and hidden
surprises. Easy-to-remove roof and ceilings provide access to the delightful interior, while the exterior of
the building features a decorative roofline and a beautifully designed façade. Can you solve the
smuggling mystery? Includes 6 minifigures with assorted accessories: Detective Ace Brickman, Al the
barber, dart player, pool player, policewoman and a mysterious lady in red. There are 2,262 pieces in
this set!
Welcome to text-based instructions from LEGO for the Blind. Before you start building, here are some
terms we’ll be using:
Front: towards you.
Back: away from you.
Up: towards the ceiling.
Down: towards the floor.
Stud: the bump on a Lego brick. Example: A 2x1 brick has two studs on it.
Vertically: going from front to back.
Horizontally: going from left to right.
Upright: pointing up towards the ceiling, and down towards the floor.
Symmetrically: a mirror image. Example: If you place a 2x1 brick with technic connector on the
front wall at the right, connector to the front, and then place another such piece symmetrically on
the back wall, at the right, the technic connector of the second piece should point to the back,
since it will be placed symmetrically.
There are also abbreviations defined at the end of this file.
