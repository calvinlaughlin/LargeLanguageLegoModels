Adapted by John Le and tested by Natalie Charbonneau.
Kids can head out on camping vacations every day with this LEGO® City 4x4 Off-Roader Adventures
(60387) playset. The 4x4 vehicle features huge tires and high suspension for a cool off-roader look. Kids
also get 2 toy mountain bikes, a LEGO tent, and cool accessories including a campfire. Just add the 2
minifigures and animal figure and let the adventures begin!
What’s in the box? – Everything kids need to build a toy 4x4, 2 mountain bikes, tent, campfire, and offroad-terrain setting, plus 2 minifigures and an animal figure.
Packed with features for imaginative play – The 4x4 features large tires, high suspension, and a flatbed
for transporting the toy mountain bikes.
Dimensions – The toy 4x4 off-roader measures over 3.5 in. (8 cm) high, 7.5 in. (19 cm) long, and 4.5 in.
(12 cm) wide.
Minifigure accessories – The LEGO accessories in this set include a toy camera, shovel, pan, and
backpack.
The front of the box shows a male minifigure riding a huge white and orange truck equipped with massive
wheels. He rides over terrain like it is nothing because of the truck’s suspension! He has a bike in the
back of the truck to go mountain biking. In the back, there is a girl on a mountain bike looking over at his
massive truck. Behind her, there is an orange tent, a fireplace, and a rabbit hiding behind the tent.
The back of the box shows the huge truck parked in the back next to the orange tent and fireplace. The 2
minifigures are both on their mountain bikes riding over the rocks and terrain! They have to be careful
though because a scorpion is hiding behind one of the rocks!
The top of the box shows both the minifigures riding their mountain bikes while a rabbit follows them and
a scorpion sits in the background on a hill.
The build is 252 pieces in total, 94 steps long, and is for ages 6+.
Bag 1 includes the pieces to make the minifigures, tent, and terrain. Bags 2 and 3 includes the pieces to
make the truck.
Welcome to text-based instructions from Bricks for the Blind. Before you start building, here are some
terms we may be using:
- In Front of/Front: towards you.
- Behind/Back: away from you.
- Up: towards the ceiling.
- Down: towards the floor.
- Stud: the bump on a LEGO brick. Example: A 2x1 brick has two studs on it.
- Vertically: going from front to behind.
- Horizontally: going from left to right.
- Upright: pointing up towards the ceiling.
- That one/ppp: previously placed piece.
- Plate: piece with studs.
- Tile: smooth piece without studs (unless otherwise specified)
- Symmetrically: a mirror image. Example: If you place a 2x1 brick with technic
connector on the front wall at the right, connector to the front, and then place another
such piece symmetrically on the back wall, at the right, the technic connector of the
second piece should point to the back since it will be placed symmetrically.
- Centered-vertically: even amount of space in front of and behind piece
- Centered-horizontally: even amount of space left and right of piece.
- Row: studs lined up from left to right.
- Column: studs lined up from top to bottom or front to back
For builders with low vision, or a sighted building partner may want to follow along with the printed visual
instructions that come with each kit, or PDF versions are always online at LEGO.com for each set:
(https://www.lego.com/en-us/service/buildinginstructions/60387) As low vision users may benefit from
viewing the instructions on a personal device where they can zoom in on content and use assistive
technologies to enhance the visuals.
Sorting the pieces:

To begin a successful build, it helps to sort the pieces into groups, bags, or small containers. Have a
friend or family member do this in advance following the instructions below. You will see that the pieces
should be sorted according to the building steps in the kit. Doing this in advance makes locating the
pieces for each step easier. See below on how to sort the pieces to correspond to the steps in this set.
Number the containers using letters A-Z, numbers, or meaningful names. The parts will be sorted into one
or a small number of steps in the instructions. Example: Steps 1-3 means collect all the parts used in
steps 1,2 and 3, and put them in one container.
This LEGO set comes with 3 bags labeled 1, 2, and 3, 2 sets of instructions, and some loose pieces. Sort
the pieces into groups or piles as described below. Note that where there are multiple colors of the same
brick in a step, the colors will be split into 2 groups to make telling the difference easier for the builder!
LEGO includes a few spare parts in case you lose something. Set these into their own group away from
the rest, in case you need them later.

Group 16 — Car
56.1. Put aside your build while we make the headlights. Locate 1 white 2x6 plate that has a round side.
Place it down horizontally in front of you with the round side facing you.
56.2. Locate 1 dark blue 1x6 plate and 1 light grey 1x2 plate with a hook. Horizontally place the 1x6 plate
on top of the 2x6 plate in the back. Now horizontally place the 1x2 plate with a hook in front of the 1x6
plate so that it is centered and the hook is facing you.
56.3. Now locate 1 black 1x2 slope tile and 2 light yellow 1x1 circular tile which represent the lights. Place
the 1x2 slope tile on top of the 1x6 plate in the center so the slope goes down towards you. To the left
and right of the slope tile, place your light yellow 1x1 circular tiles. Ask a helper if this is oriented correctly!
56.4. Now locate 2 clear 1x1 circular tiles from group 15. Place it on the dark blue 1x6 plate to the left and
right of the light yellow 1x1 circular tiles. You have finished the headlights!
57. Bring back your build so it is oriented in the same way. The hood of the car should be facing you.
Underneath the hood, place your headlight build on the side studs so it is centered and the hook part of
the build is facing down.
58. Locate 1 black bar. It should feel like two bars connected by 2 shorter bars. Horizontally connect the
middle part of the longer bar onto the hook of the headlights. When connecting this bar to the hook,
ensure that when it is parallel with the surface, the ends of the bar are facing upward. Also make sure that
the bar is flipped upwards so it is in front of the 2 studs of the hook plate.
59. Locate 1 black 1x4 tile with 2 studs. Horizontally place it behind the 4x6 hood-shaped tile so it is
centered.
60. Rotate your build 90 degrees clockwise so the hood is now facing left. Locate 1 orange 2x4 tile and 1
orange 2x2 angle plate with 2 studs.
60.1. Skip this step if you have already placed your sticker! Ask a helper to place sticker 3 on the orange
2x4 tile. It is an orange sticker with a white stripe, an orange stripe, and a dark blue stripe.
60.2. There are 6 side studs on the front side of the build. Horizontally attach the top part of the 2x4 tile to
the right 4 studs. To the left of this, place your 2x2 angle plate so the studs are both on the right. Make
sure the sticker is oriented correctly. The wider part of the angle should be at the top.
Group 17
61. Rotate your build 180 degrees so the hood is now on the right. Locate 1 orange 2x4 tile and 1 orange
2x2 angle plate with 2 studs.
61.1. Skip this step if you have already placed your sticker! Ask a helper to place sticker 2 on the orange
2x4 tile. It is an orange sticker with a white stripe, an orange stripe, and a dark blue stripe.
61.1. There are 6 side studs on the front side of the build. Horizontally attach the top part of the 2x4 tile to
the left 4 studs. To the right of this, place your 2x2 angle plate so the studs are both on the left. Make
sure the sticker is oriented correctly.
62. Rotate your build so the hood of the car is facing you. Locate 1 clear windshield piece and 1 white 2x6
tile. Horizontally place the 2x6 tile on top of the 4 studs of the windshield piece. Now horizontally place
your windshield behind the 4x6 hood tile and 1x4 tile with 2 studs. Make sure it is centered and the front
of the windshield is facing you.
63.1. Locate 2 black 3x5 L-shaped technic plates and 2 red pegs with balls attached. Lay 1 L-shaped
technic plate so it is oriented like the letter L in front of you. Insert each peg into the right hole of the Lshaped technic plate.
63.2. Turn your build upside down so the hood of the car is facing left. Insert the corner hole of the
technic plate into the front right peg of the car so the red ball is facing back. Now in the back left peg,
insert the corner hole of the technic plate so the red ball is facing you.
64.1. Locate 2 black 3x5 L-shaped technic plates and 2 red pegs with balls attached. Lay 1 L-shaped
technic plate so the long side is facing right and the short side is facing you. It should be a flipped L
shape. Insert each peg into the left hole of the L-shaped technic plate.
64.2. Insert the corner hole of the technic plate into the front left peg of the build so the red ball is facing
back. Then insert the corner hole of the other technic plate in the back right peg so the ball is facing you.
65. Now locate your white square-shaped box and open it if it already hasn’t been opened. Locate the 2
yellow rubber bands that are inside. Use 1 rubberband to connect the 2 red balls in the back. Then use
the other to connect the 2 red balls in the front. These rubber bands will act as suspension for the car so it
can go over rocks and terrain!
66. Locate 4 big black tires and 4 black cylinders. Insert each cylinder into each tire. Make sure the
cylinders are fitted correctly into the wheels. There are two sides to the cylinder, a ridged side and a side
that isn’t.
67. Locate 4 red 1x1 technic clips and 4 white 1x3 pegs with a short circular side and a longer plusshaped side. Insert each technic clip into each of the longer plus-shaped sides of the peg. Now insert
each peg into the ridged side of each of the cylinders.
68-69. Now insert the circular side of the peg that is connected to the wheel into the end holes of the
longer side of the 3x5 technic plates.
