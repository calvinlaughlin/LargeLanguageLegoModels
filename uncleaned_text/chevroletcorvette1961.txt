The Corvette comes in a box which is solid black, with a light gray band around the bottom. The light gray
band is patterned with various LEGO elements.
The front of the box shows a red classic car. This is the 1961 Corvette. The picture shows a clear view of
the front and side of the car from slightly above to allow a complete view. The front of the car has four
large circular headlights, in two pairs. The hood slopes from the windshield down to the front grill of the
car. Over the grill is the word CORVETTE. Above this is an emblem with a V overlaid over a red
Chevrolet flag and a black and white checkered flag. The wheels have spoked rims, and white wall tires.
The entire car is red, except for a white horizontal scallop starting behind the front wheel and ending on
the door under the handle. The Corvette is a convertible, meaning that the top can be removed so you
can experience the wind in your hair!
The top of the box has a side view of the Corvette model, and a life sized image of one of the wheels. The
left side of the box has a rear view of the Corvette, showing its tail lights, as well as the steering wheel,
which has a pair of crossed racing flags on the hub.
The back of the box has a main image and four inset images. The main image shows the Corvette from
behind, with the driver’s side door open to showcase the interior of the car. The top inset image shows a
side view of the Corvette with a roof on, indicating that this is an optional way to build the car! The next
inset image shows the hood open to reveal the engine, which is painted in red with chrome components.
The third inset shows that the trunk opens, revealing details inside. The final image is a side view of a real
Corvette so you can see the similarities between the model and the real deal!
The build is 1210 pieces, and 318 building steps.
§
Welcome to text-based instructions from Bricks for the Blind. Before you start building, here are some
terms we’ll be using:
- In Front of/Front: towards you.
- Behind/Back: away from you.
- Up: towards the ceiling.
- Down: towards the floor.
- Stud: the bump on a LEGO brick. Example: A 2x1 brick has two studs on it.
- Vertically: going from front to behind.
- Horizontally: going from left to right.
- Upright: pointing up towards the ceiling.
- That one/ppp: previously placed piece.
- Plate: piece with studs.
- Tile: smooth piece without studs (unless otherwise specified)
- Symmetrically: a mirror image. Example: If you place a 2x1 brick with technic connector on the front wall
at the right, connector to the front, and then place another such piece symmetrically on the back wall, at
the right, the technic connector of the second piece should point to the back, since it will be placed
symmetrically.
- Centered-vertically: even amount of space in front of and behind the piece
- Centered-horizontally: even amount of space left and right of the piece.
- Row: studs lined up horizontally (left to right/side to side).
- Column: studs lined up upright or vertically (top to bottom/back to front).
For builders with low vision, or a sighted building partner who may want to follow along with the printed
visual instructions that come with each kit, PDF versions are always online at LEGO.com:

Sorting the pieces:
To begin a successful build, it helps to sort the pieces into groups, bags or small containers. Have a
friend or family member do this in advance following the instructions below. You will see that the pieces
should be sorted according to the building steps in the kit. Doing this in advance makes locating the
pieces for each step easier. See below on how to sort the pieces to correspond to the steps in this set.
Number the containers using letters A-Z, numbers or meaningful names. The parts will be sorted into one
or a small number of steps in the instructions. Example: Steps 1-3 means collect all the parts used in
steps 1, 2 and 3, and put them in one container.
This LEGO set comes with ten plastic bags, one each labeled 1-9 and one unlabeled bag holding the
tires, two paper bags holding windshields, a sticker sheet, a brick separator, and an instruction booklet.
Sort the pieces into groups as described below. Note that where there are multiple colors of the same
brick in a step, the colors will be split across two groups to make telling the difference easier for the
builder! LEGO includes a few spare parts in case you lose something. Set these into their own group
away from the rest, in case you need them later.

A note on LEGO Technic™ part names. These parts are somewhat different from regular LEGO bricks.
Here are some definitions in case the builder or helper is not familiar with LEGO Technic™.
Axles - An axle is a connector which has an X shaped cross-section. Because their cross section is not
round, anything connected to an axle using an axle-hole will rotate with that axle. Axles are longer than
they are wide, and the length of an axle corresponds with how many bricks long it is. Aka a 3L axle is
three bricks long. Axles come in a variety of lengths, with a 2L axle being the shortest available. They
may be combined with pins, or have circular stops on them. A stop prevents the axle from sliding through
an axle-hole at a specific point on the axle.
Pins - A pin is a connector which has a circular cross section and a flanged notch out of one or both ends.
This flanged notch allows them to click into bricks with a pin-hole. Pins come with and without friction
ridges, which are small bumps on the pin which prevent them from rotating freely. For standard pins,
black is a high friction pin, and gray is a low friction pin. A standard length pin is two brick lengths long,
with a stop in the middle. This prevents a brick from being pushed from one side of the pin to the other. A
1L pin is one brick long and still retains the stop, however it also includes a hollow stud at the other end.
A 3L pin is three bricks long, and only contains a stop at one side, allowing two bricks to be pushed onto
the other side of the pin. Pins may also have one side which is an axle.
Lift-arms - A lift-arm is a basic structural element, similar to a brick or a plate, but usually without any
studs. It is a beam with rounded ends and with holes in it, with the same spacing as the studs on a LEGO
brick. lift-arms come in a variety of lengths, including a 1x1 lift-arm which looks like a cylinder. Thick liftarms are as wide as a LEGO brick, and thin lift-arms are half as wide as a LEGO brick, but not the same
thickness as a LEGO plate! The holes in a lift-arm arm may accept axles or pins. They also come in a
variety of shapes, including tees, ells and triangles.
Gears - A gear is a functional element. They are typically discs with teeth on the outside, there are also
worm gears which look like a spiraling cylinder! Gears connected by axles transmit or even transform
rotational motion!
Axle and Pin Connectors - These elements are typically smaller than lift-arms and are used to connect
some combination of pins or axles. They might have pins or axles, as well as axle or pin-holes. They have
a lot of different angle combinations! The simplest just connects two axles or pins together in a straight
line.
Bushes/Bushings - LEGO Technic™ uses bushes largely as spacers, but they also can reduce friction
between rotating parts, or can form useful elements such as handles. Bushes are typically light gray,
generally cylindrical, and have an axle-hole running through the middle. They have a flange at the front
and back to make them easier to pull on and off

Building Instructions:
Open bag 1.
Open group 1.
1.1. We will start with the chassis of the car! This is the frame which the rest of the car is built upon. Place
a black 6x8 hollow rectangle brick, horizontally long in front of you.
1.2. Place a yellow 2L pin into the center pin hole on the front side of the previous piece, pushing it in
from the back side so it extends into the hollow rectangle of the previous piece. Place another
symmetrically on the back row.
2.1. Skip a pin-hole to the right of the pieces from the previous step, and place two more yellow 2L pins
on the front and back sides of the 6x8 brick, in the same orientation.
2.2. Place a blue 3L pin to the left of the first 2L pin on the front row. With the stop ring at the back, push it
in from the back all the way to the stop so it extends evenly to the front and back. Place another
symmetrically on the back row. There should now be two rows of pins extending into the hollow rectangle,
with the first and fourth pin-holes from the left in the hollow rectangle empty.
3. Place a black 1x6 brick with pin-holes, horizontally long, on the front row of pins in the solid rectangle.
Place another symmetrically on the back row of pins. The hollow rectangle should now be only two rows
wide.
4.1. Find the blue 3L pin extending to the front of the chassis. Place two blue 3L pins, with the stop rings
at the back, in the pin-holes to the left of the existing 3L pin. They should extend two brick lengths (2L) to
the front.
4.2. Place a black 1x16 brick with pin-holes, horizontally long, on the side onto the three pins on the front
of the chassis. Push it on from the front, attaching the pins to the rightmost three pin holes on the 1x16
brick.
Open group 2.
5.1. Place a black 4x6 hollow rectangle brick, vertically long, in front of you.
5.2. Push a black 2L pin into the rightmost hole on the front of the previous piece from the front. Place
another symmetrically on the back.
5.3. Push a blue 3L pin into the leftmost hole of the 4x6 brick, with the stop ring at the back so it extends
2L to the front. Place another symmetrically on the back.
5.4. Keeping the 3L pin on the left, push the pins on this assembly onto the 1x16 brick so its right edge
touches the 6x8 brick from step 1. Push it in from the back side until it touches the 1x16 brick. The 1x16
brick should extend past this piece by 8 studs.
6.1. We’re going to extend the chassis some more, so set the main portion of the chassis aside for now.
Place a black 1x6 brick with pin-holes on the side, vertically long, in front of you.
6.2. Place a blue 3L pin into the second and fourth holes from the front. Push them in from the left, with
the stop ring at the right so they extend 2L to the left.
7. Attach a black 6x8 hollow rectangle brick, horizontally long, to the previous pieces, aligned with the
front and back edges of the 1x6 brick. Push it on from the left so it extends to the left. The 3L pins should
extend 1L into the hollow rectangle on this piece.
8. Place two red 1x2 bricks with a single pin-hole, vertically long, one onto each of the pins extending into
the right side of the hollow rectangle. Push them on from the left.
9.1. Place a red 2x3 plate horizontally long in front of you.
9.2. Place a red 1x2 plate, vertically long, on the rightmost column of the previous piece.
9.3. Place a light gray 1x2 brick with a pin-hole and a 1x2 plate, with the hole at the front, in the front row
of the 2x3, to the left of the previous piece. Attach the plate portion onto the 2x3 plate so the bottoms are
even. It should overhang one stud to the front. Place another symmetrically behind the first.
9.4. Place a red 2x3 plate, horizontally long and centered vertically, on the pieces from the previous step,
even with the left side so it extends onto the 1x2 plate at the right of the assembly.
9.5. Keep this orientation, place this assembly into the hollow rectangle on the 6x8 brick from step 7.
Push it all the way against the left edge of the hollow rectangle. Attach it by pushing a 3L pin into the
second pin-hole from the left on the front side, inserting the pin from the front, with the stop ring at the
back so it extends 1L to the front. Push in another pin, symmetrically on the back side, to fully attach the
assembly. This will form the base for the trunk of the car!
10. Place a blue 3L pin, with the stop ring at the back, into the rightmost pin-hole on the front side of this
assembly, pushing it in from the front with the stop ring at the back, so it extends 2L to the front. Place
another symmetrically on the back side.
11. Put the rest of the chassis in front of you, horizontally long, with the 1x16 brick extending to the left.
Attach the new assembly we created to the 1x16 brick by pushing the front pins into the back of the 1x16
brick. The leftmost pin on the new assembly should go into the leftmost hole on the 1x16 brick, so the
right edge of the assembly touches the left edge of a 4x6 brick with a hollow rectangle.
12. Rotate the chassis 180 degrees so it is still horizontally long, and so the 1x16 brick is at the back.
Place another 1x16 brick with pin-holes on the front side, symmetrically to the one on the back side.
13. Place two blue 3L pins into the second and third holes from the left on the previous piece, pushing
them in from the front, with the stop rings at the front. These should extend 1L to the front, and should be
symmetric with a pair of 3L pins on the back side of the chassis.
Open group 3.
14.1. Now we’re going to build the drive axle! The 1961 Chevrolet Corvette is a rear wheel drive car, so
this axle sits under the trunk of the car. Build the center portion of the axle by attaching two black 2L
straight axle connectors together using a red 2L axle. Remember that the trunk is on the right of the car
as it sits now.
14.2. Place the center of the axle into the rightmost hollow area on the chassis. It should be in line with
the fourth hole from the right on the two 1x16 bricks. Push a light gray 7L axle through the 4th hole from
the right, on the front side, while holding the axle connectors in place until the axle slides in. Slide another
7L axle in from the back. This is the drive axle!
15.1. Place a 3L axle into the pin-hole to the right of the front 7L axle, pushing it in from the front with the
stop ring at the back. Place another to the right of the first in the same orientation. Repeat these
symmetrically on the back side of the chassis.
15.2. Push a dark gray 1x2 brick with two pin-holes, horizontally long, over the two pins at the front from
the previous step. Push it all the way back against the chassis then put another dark gray 1x2 brick with
two holes in front of it. The front two pins from the previous step should now be covered up. Repeat the
previous two pieces symmetrically on the back of the chassis.
16.1. Place a 3L pin into the pin-hole to the left of the front 7L axle, pushing it in from the front with the
stop ring at the back, then place another symmetrically on the back side of the chassis.
16.2. Push a dark gray 1x2 brick with two pin-holes, horizontally long, over the 7L axle and the pin at the
front from the previous step. Push it all the way back against the chassis then put another dark gray 1x2
brick with two holes in front of it. These should touch the first set of 1x2 bricks with two pin-holes. Repeat
this symmetrically on the back.
17.1. Place a 3L pin into the first open pin-hole to the left of the pieces from the previous step, which
should be the second hole to the left. Push it in from the front with the stop ring at the back, then place
another symmetrically on the back side of the chassis. There should be another pin to the right of these
two pieces, extending 1L from the chassis.
17.2. Push a dark gray 1x2 brick with two pin-holes, horizontally long, onto the pin from the previous step,
extending to the right so it touches another 1x2 brick with pin holes. Push it all the way back against the
chassis then put another dark gray 1x2 brick with two holes in front of it. Repeat this symmetrically on the
back.
Open group 4.
18.1. We’ll start building out the floor of the trunk now! The trunk is a darker shade of red than the exterior
of the car. Find a red 2x3 step plate. This is essentially two 2x2 plates connected by a 1x2 brick so they
look kind of like a letter Z if it only had right angles. Place this horizontally long in front of you, with the
higher plate at the left.
18.2. Place a red 1x4 brick with four studs on one side, vertically long with the side studs at the right, on
the lower plate of the previous piece, overhanging two rows to the back.
18.3. Place another 2x3 step plate, horizontally long, behind the first step plate, with the upper plate at the
left, in line with the first step plate. The tops of these three pieces should all be even.
18.4. Keeping the side studs at the right, attach this assembly to the rightmost column on the chassis of
the car, centered vertically. The studs will hold the license plate!
19.1. Place a red 1x1 plate in front of the leftmost column of the assembly from the previous steps. Place
another symmetrically behind the assembly.
19.2. Place a dark red 1x8 tile, vertically long and centered vertically, to the left of the previous piece.
Place four more, in the same orientation, to the left of the first.
19.3. Place a dark red 1x3 jumper plate, horizontally long, to the left of the front row of the leftmost 1x8
tile from the previous step. A jumper plate is a 1x2 plate with a single stud on top, or a 1x3 plate with only
two studs on top. Place two more 1x3 jumper plates, in the same orientation, behind the first. Place three
more symmetrically on the back of the chassis.
19.4. Place a red 2x2 plate in front of the front column of jumper plates. It should be aligned with the
columns of studs on the jumper plates. Place another behind the back column of jumper plates. This
completes the upholstery on the floor of the trunk!
Open group 5.
20.1. Now we’ll extend the chassis farther to the left! Push a blue 3L pin into the leftmost pin-hole on the
back of the chassis, pushing it in from the back with the stop ring at the front. Place another into the third
hole from the left, also pushing it in from the back with the stop ring at the front.
20.2. Push a 1x16 brick with pin-holes, horizontally long, on the previous pieces so it overhangs 12 studs
to the left.
21.1. Place a yellow 2x4 plate, vertically long, in front of you.
21.2. Place a light gray 1x2 brick with a pin-hole and a 1x2 plate, with the hole at the front, on the
previous piece so it overhangs one row to the front. The 1x2 plate portion should attach to the 2x4 plate,
and the bottoms should be even. Place another symmetrically on the back of the 2x4 plate.
21.3. Place a blue 3L pin into the front hole, pushing from the front with the stop ring at the back. Place
another symmetrically into the back hole.
21.4. Place a yellow 2x4 plate, vertically long and centered vertically, on this assembly.
21.5. Attach this assembly to the chassis by pushing the back pin into the rightmost open hole of the last
1x16 brick. The right end of this assembly should touch the rest of the chassis, and be even at the front.
22.1. Push a blue 3L pin into the first open hole on the 1x16 brick to the left of the previous assembly.
Pushing it in from the front with the stop ring at the front so it extends 1L in front and 1L behind the 1x16
brick.
22.2. Skip a hole to the left and push a black 2L pin into the 1x16 brick from the front.
22.3. Attach a black 4x6 hollow rectangle brick, vertically long, by pushing it from the front onto the pins
from the previous two steps. Its right side should touch the assembly from steps 21.1-21.3.
22.4. Push a black 2L pin into the leftmost hole, a blue 3L pin into the rightmost hole, on the front of the
previous piece. Push both pins in from the front, with the stop ring of the 3L pin at the back.
23. Place another 1x16 brick with pin-holes on the front side, symmetrically to the leftmost one on the
back side.
24. Push a blue 3L pin into the rightmost hole of the previous piece, pushing it in from the front with the
stop ring at the front, so it extends 1L to the front. Skip a hole to the left, and push in another in the same
orientation. There should now be one axle, and seven pins extending on each of the front and back sides
of the chassis.
25.1. Find the rightmost pin on the front. Push a black 2L pin into the holes to the left and right of it,
pushing them in from the front. Repeat this on the back side as well.
25.2. Find the four, leftmost pins on the front. These should be in every other hole, so there are three
open holes in this row. Push a black 2L pin into these holes, pushing them in from the front. Repeat this
on the back side as well. There should now be three rows of pins on the front and back: a row of seven
pins on the left, a row of two in the middle, and a row of three at the right.
26.1. Push a dark gray 1x2 brick with two pin-holes, horizontally long, onto the rightmost pair of pins on
the front. Push another onto the third and fourth pins from the left. There should be two open pins to the
left of this piece. Repeat this symmetrically on the back.
26.2. Attach a 2x3 step plate, vertically long, onto the two pieces from the previous step at the front of the
build. Attach the upper plate to the top of the 1x2 bricks with pin holes, so it overhangs by two studs and
the lower plate is at the front. Repeat this symmetrically on the back.
Open group 6.
27.1. Push a dark gray 1x2 brick with two pin-holes, horizontally long, onto the pins to the left, and right of
the leftmost step plates. Do this for both the front and back.
27.2. Attach a 2x3 step plate, vertically long, onto the four pieces from the previous step, like we did

259. Find two light gray 2L thick lift-arms with two thin 1L perpendicular lift-arms. This looks like a letter U,
where the bottom of the U has two pin-holes, and each arm has an axle hole. Rotate one of these pieces
so it looks like a sideways letter U with the arms on the left. Attach the top pin-hole to the pin on the right
hand side of the trunk. Place the other, in the same orientation, on the left pin inside the trunk.
260.1. Now we will make the trunk. Set the car aside. Place a red 8x2 curved slope in front of you,
vertically long with the smooth side down, with the cut-out at the front.
260.2. Place a red 1x10 plate, horizontally long with the studs down, on the front row of anti-stud on the
previous piece, even with the right side of the previous piece so it extends 8 studs to the left.
261. Place a red 8x2 curved slope, in the same orientation as the first one (from step 260.1), to the left of
the first one. Place two more red 8x2 curved slopes symmetrically on the left side of the trunk.
262.1. Place a light gray 1x2 plate with a pin-hole on one end, vertically long with the pin-hole at the front
and the studs down, on the front two anti-studs of the second column from the right.
262.2. Place a light gray 1x6 plate, horizontally long with the studs down, to the left of the back anti-stud
of the previous piece.
262.3. Place a light gray 1x2 plate with a pin-hole on one end, vertically long with the pin-hole at the front
and the studs down, to the left of the previous piece, even with the front of the trunk.
263. Place a black 6x8 plate, horizontally long with the studs down, centered horizontally and vertically on
the anti-stud of the trunk. There should be one open anti-stud all around this piece.
264.1. Now we’ll make the attachment linkage for the trunk. Find a light gray axle connector with a pinhole at one end. This has one end with an axle hole, and the other end has a perpendicular pin-hole.
Place a black 2L pin into the pin hole, and a light gray 3L axle into the axle hole. 
264.2. Repeat step 264.1 to make another linkage.
264.3. Attach one linkage to the right 1x2 plate with a pin-hole, pushing the pin from the linkage into the
pin-hole from the right. Rotate the axle so it is pointed to the front. Place the other linkage symmetrically
on the left side of the trunk. Now flip the trunk over so it’s smooth on top and the axles from the linkages
are at the back.
Open group 52.
265. Place a red 2x8 curved slope with a Corvette logo sticker in the gap between the other 2x8 curved
slopes, in the same orientation.
266. Place the car in front of you, with the trunk at the back. Find the two U-shaped lift-arms from step
259. Make sure that the axle hole on each of these is on top and at the back. Push the two axles from the
trunk down into these axle holes from the top, with the smooth side of the trunk at the back. The trunk
should be able to swing down to close at the front. To open it again, you can feel under the back right
corner of the bumper to find a lift-arm you can push up to pop the trunk open.
267.1. Place a light gray 1x12 plate, horizontally long, in front the trunk we just placed. It should connect
to two 2x3 inverted slopes at the left and right side.
267.2. Place a red 1x4 tile, horizontally long, on the left four studs of the previous piece. Place another
symmetrically on the right side.
267.3. Place a red 1x4 tile with a stud on each end, horizontally long, between the previous two pieces.
There is a note on this page: “The trunk is large and family-friendly, with room for alternative license
plates: A showroom version, a California plate (C1 1961 – the model name and release year of the car)
and a Michigan plate (home of General Motors – GM).”
Open group 53.
268.1. Now we’ll start on the engine. Set the car aside for now. Place a red 4x6 plate, horizontally long, in
front of you.
268.2. Place a dark gray 1x2 double plate with rounded ends, vertically long and centered vertically, on
the right column of the previous piece.

269.3. Place a red 1x1 circular plate on the previous piece.
270.1. Assemble six 1x2 hinges by attaching six light gray 1x2 hinge plates to six red 1x2 hinge bases.
270.2. Place three of the hinges in a horizontal row on the front row of the 4x6 plate. Place them so the
flat side of the hinge is at the back. This will allow the hinge to rotate forwards. Place the other three
hinges symmetrically on the back row of the 4x6 plate.
271.1. Place a light gray 1x1 tile with an upwards clip on the leftmost stud of the front row of hinge plates,
with the clip oriented vertically.
271.2. Place a light gray 1x1 tile with one rounded end, on the left most stud of the back row of hinge
plates, with the rounded end at the left.
271.3. Place a light gray 1x4 tile with a Corvette valve cover logo to the right of the previous piece.
271.4. Place a light gray 1x1 tile with one rounded end, with the rounded end at the right, to the right of
the previous piece.
271.5. Repeat steps 271.3-271.4 symmetrically on the front of the engine.
271.6. Now, rotate the front row of hinge plates forwards about 45 degrees, and the back row backwards
about the same. These two parallel sets of tiles represent the valve covers on the Corvette’s 283 cubic
inch V-8 engine.
272.1. Place a light gray 1x3 plate, vertically long and centered vertically, on the right column of the
engine. The studs on the rounded 1x2 brick on the right column are hollow so they can allow the 1x3
plate to be centered vertically.
272.2. Place a 1x1 tile with one rounded end on the front stud of the previous piece, with the rounded
corner at the right. Place another behind the first, with the rounded corner at the left. Place a third behind
the second, with the rounded corner at the left.
272.3. Place a dark gray 2x2 circular plate, centered vertically, on the third and fourth columns from the
left on the engine.
273.1. Now we’ll attach the air cleaner. This assembly holds the air filter which keeps debris out of the
engine! Place a light gray 4x4 circular plate, centered vertically and horizontally, on the previous piece.
273.2. Place a metallic light gray 2x2 circular tile on the previous piece, centered horizontally and
vertically.
273.3. Place four metallic light gray 2x2 quarter circle tiles with a quarter circular cutout, around the
previous piece. They should form a complete circle.
274.1. Make the oil fill cap by placing a 1x1 circular plate with an angled bar into the hollow stud centered
vertically on the left column of the engine. Push the bar of this piece into the hollow stud, and rotate the
stud so it points back. Attach a black 1x1 circular tile to the stud of the previous piece.
274.2. Make the oil filter by clipping the hand of a light gray mug, with the wide side of the mug at the
right, onto the clip on the front valve cover. Use the handle to hinge the mug up so it extends out parallel
to the ground.
275. Now it’s time to put the engine into the engine bay! Put the car in front of you, with the trunk at the
right. Install the engine by placing it, with the oil fill cap at the left, into the engine bay at the left side of the
car. It should be just to the right of the gears, and extend right to the firewall.
Open group 54.
276. Now we will make the hood, set the car aside for now. Place a red 2x8 plate, horizontally long, in
front of you. Place another in front of the previous piece. We’ll connect these in the next step.
277. Place a red 2x4 tile, vertically long, on the left two columns of the previous two pieces.
278. Place a red 2x4 tile, horizontally long and centered vertically, to the right of the previous piece. Place
another, vertically long, to the right of the first.
279. Place a red 1x10 plate, vertically long and centered vertically, under the rightmost column of antistud on the hood. Place another symmetrically on the left side of the hood.
280. Place a red 5x8 curved slope with a Corvette emblem on the hood, horizontally long with the 1x4 tile
at the back. The 1x4 tile should fit into the four studs in front of the horizontal 2x4 tile. Flip the hood over,
with the curved slope at the front and the anti-stud on top. The two 1x10 plates should be vertically long
on the left and right sides of the hood.
281.1. Place a red 1x4 plate, horizontally long, in front of you.
281.2. Place a dark gray 1x2 plate with a vertical clip on one short side, vertically long with the clip at the
front, on the left stud of the previous piece. Attach the back stud of the 1x2 plate with a clip to the 1x4
plate. Place another symmetrically on the right side of the 1x4 plate.
281.3. Place a dark gray 2x2 plate between the previous two pieces, attaching the back row to the 1x4
plate.
281.4. Place a black 2x4 plate, horizontally long, on the previous three pieces. Flip this assembly over so
the studs are down, and the two clips are at the front.
281.4. Attach this assembly, centered horizontally, to the second and third rows of anti-stud from the back
of the hood. This assembly is the hinge to open the hood.
Open group 55.
282. Place a red 5x8 curved slope symmetrically to the first 5x8 curved slope on the front of the hood.
There should be a single row of anti-stud at the front of the previous piece after this step.
283. Place two red 1x4 plates, horizontally long, in a horizontal row on the front row of anti-stud from the
previous piece. Rotate the hood so the anti-stud is down, and the two clips are at the left.
284. Place the car in front of you, with the engine at the left. Locate the two bars to the left of the radiator
fan. These are just to the right of a column of 1x2 slope tiles. Attach the two clips on the hood to these
two bars. Now the hood should hinge open and closed. The Corvette has a hood which opens at the
windshield, rather than at the front of the car!
Open bag 9.
Open group 56.
285.1. Now we will put the wheels on the car, starting with the front wheels. Flip the car over so it is
upside down, with the engine on the left. From the group, find a white 1L pin and put a black 1x1 tile on
the stud side of it. Repeat these two pieces to make another pin/tile assembly.
285.2. Find the two wheel wells at the left side of the car. There are two bricks with pin-holes on the top of
the chassis. Place one of the pin/tile assemblies from the previous step into the third open hole from the
left, pushing it in from the front with the tile at the front. Repeat this symmetrically at the back.
286.1. Now we will start the mechanism which allows the front wheels to be steered with the steering
wheel. Find a black steering arm with two pins. This looks like two parallel triangles connected by a flat
plate. The flat plate has two 1L pins on one side, and the triangles have a pin hole at the point. Place this
in front of you, with the pins in a horizontal row at the back.
286.2. Attach a dark gray 3L thick lift-arm to the previous piece, by aligning the axle hole at one end of
the liftarm with the pin-hole between the two triangles from the previous piece. Slide a light gray 3L axle
pin combo through the holes to connect the two pieces, pushing it in from the bottom with the pin side at
the bottom.
286.3. Repeat steps 286.1-286.2 to make another steering arm assembly.
286.4. Attach the two pins at the back of one steering arm assembly to the two holes on the front brick
with pin-holes, to the left of the pin/tile assembly from step 285.2. The pin portion of the pin/axle combo
from step 286.2 should be down. Place the other steering arm assembly symmetrically on the back side
of the car.
Open group 57.
287.1. Now we’ll work on the assembly which connects the steering wheel to the wheels. Set the car
aside for now. Place a light gray perpendicular axle and pin connector in front of you, with the axle hole at
the left, and the pin-hole pointing up.
287.2. Push a light gray 3L axle/pin combo through the axle hole, pushing it in from the front with the pin
at the front. Push it all the way up to the stop so it is centered on the axle and pin connector.
288. Push a red 1L pin with a tow ball on one end into the bottom of the pin hole on the axle and pin
connector from step 287.1. The ball should be on the bottom.
289. Push a light gray 4L thin lift-arm, horizontally long, over the axle/pin combo from step 287.2. Push
the left axle hole of the lift-arm over the axle portion of the axle/pin combo from the back. Place another
4L thin lift-arm, in the same orientation on the first.
290.1. Place a light gray perpendicular axle and pin connector in front of you, with the axle hole at the
right, and the pin-hole pointing up.
290.2. Push a light gray 3L axle/pin combo through the axle hole, pushing it in from the front with the pin
at the front. Push it all the way up to the stop so it is centered on the axle and pin connector.
290.3. Push a red 1L pin with a tow ball on one end into the bottom of the pin hole on the axle and pin
connector from step 290.1. The ball should be on the bottom.
290.4. Attach this assembly to the two liftarms from step 289 by pushing the axle portion of the axle/pin
combo into the rightmost axle hole on the liftarms. The tow ball should remain at the bottom and this
assembly should be symmetric to the assembly from steps 287-288.
291. Attach a dark gray 1x2 brick with two pin-holes, horizontally long, to the front left pin of the assembly
so the left end is even with the left end of the assembly. Place another symmetrically on the front right
pin. These two bricks should touch in the center of the assembly.
292. Place a light gray 1x4 flat gear tile, horizontally long, on the pieces from the previous step. Flip the
assembly over so the gear is on the left at the bottom, and the two tow balls are in a vertical row at the
top.
293. Now, set the car back in front of you, upside down with the engine at the left. Find the gap in the
chassis between the two steering arm assemblies. You should be able to feel the steering gears in the left
column of this gap. Place the assembly, centered vertically, with the flat gear into this gap, with the tow
balls at the top, and the flat gear on the left so it meshes with the existing gears. This assembly will not be
physically attached yet.
294.1. Place a black 2x8 plate, vertically long and centered vertically, on the chassis, just to the right of
the two tow-balls.
294.2. Place a black 1x8 plate with a rail on one side, vertically long with the rail at the right, to the right of
the previous piece. Place another, vertically long with the rail at the right, just to the left of the two towballs.
295.1. Now turn your attention to the two 3L thick lift-arms attached to the steering arm assembly. Rotate
both of these so they are pointing right. Place a light gray 1L axle with a tow ball on one end into the right
axle hole of the lift arms, pushing them in from the top with the tow ball at the top.
295.2. Find two black 1x6 tow ball linkages. These look like an axle with a circle on each end. Attach one
circle to each tow ball from the previous step, then attach the other end to the tow balls from step 290.3.
295.3. Now, push a 3L axle/pin combo into the middle pin-hole on the 3L lift arms. For the front lift arm,
push the pin in from the front so the axle extends to the front. Repeat this symmetrically for the back side.
Open group 58.
296. Make four wheels by pushing a white hub into a black rubber tire. The hubs have one side with five
spokes, and one side with a raised circle in the middle. Attach the wheels to the axles in each of the
wheel wells, with the side with the five spokes on the inside so it is hidden.
297. Place a light gray 3x3 disk with a hubcap pattern on each of the axles on the outside of each of the
wheels, with the hubcap pattern pointing out. The printing on the hubcaps is only on one side and is not
tactile, so you may need to ask a sighted helper to orient these. Now flip the car over so it rests on its
wheels, with the engine at the left.
Open group 59.
298.1. Now we will build the car’s radio antenna! Start by placing a light gray 1x1 circular plate on the
second stud from the right in front of the trunk. This stud is two rows from the front, above the right wheel.
Place another 1x1 circular plate on the first.
298.2. Place a metallic silver foil, with the bar down, into the hollow stud of the previous piece so it points
upwards. A foil is a very thin type of sword with a dome shaped handguard used for fencing.
298.3. Place two light gray 1x1 circular plates with a 1L bar, on the studs to the right of each of the seats,
with the bar pointing to the left.
299.1. Next is the rear view mirror. Locate the vertically long 1x2 jumper plate on the dashboard. This is
centered vertically and is right above the gear shifter. Find a light gray 1x1 circular plate with a 1L bar on
one side. Push the bar of this piece into the hollow stud of the jumper plate, with the stud at the right.
299.2. Place a clear 1x2 tile onto the stud of the previous piece, centered vertically. Attach this tile so it is
longest in the front to back direction. This is the rear view mirror!
300.1. Now we’ll build the speedometer. Find the four upright studs on the dashboard in front of the
mirror. Place a black 1x2 half circle tile on the left column of these studs, with the flat side at the right.
300.2. Place a black 1x2 plate, vertically long, to the right of the previous piece.
300.3. Place a black 1x2 plate with two studs sticking up from one long side, vertically long with the side
studs at the right, on the previous piece.

300.5. Place a black 1x2 half circle tile with a speedometer sticker on the side studs of the 1x2 plate with
two studs sticking up from one long side from step 300.3, with the flat side at the bottom.
301.1. Now we will build the mirrors on the doors. Locate the hinges for the doors. Note there are tiles to
the left and right of the hinges, but two exposed studs at the hinges for each door, with the right exposed
stud being one plate lower than the left. Place a red 1x1 thick plate on the right stud on both the front and
back sides.
301.2. Place a red 2x2 plate, oriented like a Braille letter F, to the left of the front piece from the previous
step. Place another symmetrically to the left of the back piece from the previous step.
301.3. Make two mirrors by attaching two clear 1x1 circular tiles to two light gray 1x1 circular plates with a
1L bar on one side.
301.4. Push the bar of a mirror into each of the hollow studs of the 1x1 thick plate from step 301.1, with
the circular tile at the right.
302.1. Place a light gray 1x1 plate behind the front mirror, and another in front of the back mirror.
302.2. Place a light gray 3x3 rounded corner tile with a rounded cut out, to the left of the front 1x1 from
the previous step, oriented so it curves back to the left. Place another symmetrically on the backside of
the car. The left ends of these pieces should touch a vertically long 1x6 plate.
303. Assemble the steering wheel by placing a black 2x2 circular tile with a sticker onto the four studs at
the center of the black steering wheel. The steering wheel has the Corvette logo on the center. Then
install the steering wheel to the axle sticking out to the left of the driver’s seat. The steering wheel has an
axle hole running through the middle of it you will use for this purpose. Try turning the steering wheel. The
left set of wheels should turn!
304. Place a clear 4x12x3 windshield on the vertically long 1x6 plate to the right of the hood. Place it
vertically long and centered vertically with the sloping side at the left. The left column of the windshield
attaches to the 1x6 plate. Now the Corvette is complete as a convertible with the top down! Next we’ll
build the removable hardtop, set the car aside for now.
Open group 61.

extending back one row onto the anti-stud of the hardtop. Repeat this piece symmetrically on the back
side of the hardtop.
315.1. Place a red 1x2 brick, horizontally long, on the anti-stud of each pair of 1x3x2 curved slopes.
315.2. Place a light gray 1x1 plate on the right anti-stud of each piece from the previous step.
316. Place a light gray 5x5 rounded corner plate with a 4x4 rounded cut out to the left of the front 1x1
plate from the previous step, curving back to the left. Place another symmetrically to the left of the back
1x1 plate from the previous step. Now flip the hard top over so the anti-stud is down and the pieces from
this step are at the left.
317.1. Place a clear 4x12x3 windshield, vertically long with the slope on the left, on the pieces from the
previous step. This makes the rear window of the hardtop.
317.2. Place a light gray 1x2 plate, vertically long and centered vertically, on the left column of anti-stud
on the previous piece.
318. Now place the car in front of you, with the engine at the left. Attach the hardtop to the car to the right
of the windshield. The rear window of the car should be at the right. It should attach to the two exposed
studs to the right of the seats. The hardtop can be removed if you want the car to be a convertible again!
Congratulations! Now the 1961 Chevrolet Corvette is complete!
Thank you so much for building this set!
