6790 Western Bandit’s Wheel Gun
Adapted and tested by Matthew Shifrin
Keep the Sheriff at bay with the Bandit’s Wheel Gun! With his wheeled gun, a revolver, and a lit stick of
dynamite at the ready, this bandit’s not going down without a fight!
This is an easy build and a neat starter set. There're 2 guns on the top of that wagon and on the front, you
can see a sign which says, 'KEEP OUT'. There's a black wheel on each side and a handle on the back
where the minifig can move this wagon around. This set also comes with a barrel with a stick of dynamite.
This set is cool for a small set and a great army builder.
The bandit comes with a brown cowboy hat, a white bandanna, a revolver, dark gray pants and a black
jacket with a blue shirt. This minifig has black hair and a black beard on his face.
The build is 21 pieces in total and includes one Minifigure.
Welcome to text-based instructions from Bricks for the Blind. Before you start building, here are some
terms we may be using:
- In Front of/Front: towards you.
- Behind/Back: away from you.
- Up: towards the ceiling.
- Down: towards the floor.
- Stud: the bump on a LEGO brick. Example: A 2x1 brick has two studs on it.
- Vertically: going from front to behind.
- Horizontally: going from left to right.
- Upright: pointing up towards the ceiling.
- That one/ppp: previously placed piece.
- Plate: piece with studs.
- Tile: smooth piece without studs (unless otherwise specified)
- Symmetrically: a mirror image. Example: If you place a 2x1 brick with technic
connector on the front wall at the right, connector to the front, and then place another
such piece symmetrically on the back wall, at the right, the technic connector of the
second piece should point to the back since it will be placed symmetrically.
- Centered-vertically: even amount of space in front of and behind piece
- Centered-horizontally: even amount of space left and right of piece.
- Row: studs lined up from left to right.
- Column: studs lined up from top to bottom or front to back
Let’s build the wheel gun.
1. Put a grey 3x2 plate horizontally on the table in front of you.
2. Put a black 2x1 plate with side handles vertically on the rightmost column of the previous piece, side
handles to the right.
3. Put a black 4x2 plate horizontally to the left of the previous piece, overhanging to the left.
4. Put a black 2x2 plate with small pins on two sides vertically underneath the left end of the previous
piece, pins to the front and to the back.
5. Put a light gray 2x1 plate with 4x1 side studs vertically on the left end of the previous piece, side-studs
to the left.
6. Put a black tile printed with yellow lettering reading, “Keep Out!” Upright on the previous piece’s side
studs.
7. Put two 1x1 plates with top clasp vertically on top of the studs of the 2x1-4x1 plate from step 5. Take
two grey rifles and clip each of them into one of the clasps, so that their muzzles face left, stocks to the
right.
8. Attach two black wagon wheels onto the pins at the front and back of the build so that the gun can
roll—there’s only one way to attach them, make sure your spokes are facing outward.
9. Put a 2x1 tile printed with a stick of dynamite with a lit fuse, (The tile is gray and the dynamite stick is
red) into a 2x2 barrel and put a gray revolver into the barrel as well.
Now build your bandit.
Put the legs left horizontally on the table in front of you so the toes point towards you. Then put the torso
on top, so the bandit’s hands are pointing towards you. His legs are gray and he wears a black suit over a
white shirt. He also wears a belt, from which a pair of handcuffs dangles. Before you attach his head, put
the neckerchief onto his torso, and secure it with his head. His head is decorated with black hair, black
eyes, black eyebrows, and a black mustache. He wears a cowboy hat.
Congratulations! You’re done!
Now your bandit’s ready to give the sheriff a run for his money!
