10243 Parisian Restaurant
Welcome to text-based instructions from LEGO for the Blind. Before you start building, here are some
terms we’ll be using:
Front: towards you.
Back: away from you.
Up: towards the ceiling.
Down: towards the floor.
Stud: the bump on a Lego brick. Example: A 2x1 brick has two studs on it.
Vertically: going from front to back.
Horizontally: going from left to right.
Upright: pointing up towards the ceiling, and down towards the floor.
Symmetrically: a mirror image. Example: If you place a 2x1 brick with technic connector on the
front wall at the right, connector to the front, and then place another such piece symmetrically on
the back wall, at the right, the technic connector of the second piece should point to the back,
since it will be placed symmetrically.
There are also abbreviations defined at the end of this file.
It’s very busy in the Parisian Restaurant! As a scooter zips by, inside the waiter rushes between the
tables as the nervous young man gets ready to propose with the ring! It’s just as hectic behind the
scenes, with the chef busily preparing the food. This beautifully detailed building is the setting for so many
stories and is a great addition to the modular building series. The Parisian Restaurant has a fully stocked,
blue and white tiled kitchen with tableware as well as a cozy apartment with pull-down bed, kitchenette
and fireplace. On the top floor is the artist’s room with a studio that includes a cast iron heater, easel,
paintbrush and two works of art by the aspiring artist. Outside, stairs lead down to the roof terrace lined
with hanging lanterns and flowers where the diners eat alfresco style.
