Skate park playset – Send kids’ imaginations soaring with this LEGO City Street Skate Park (60364), with
combinable ramp modules for different park configurations.
What’s in the box? – Everything kids need to build a toy skate park with modular ramps and equipment
for all kinds of stunts, plus a BMX bike, skateboard, scooter, in-line skates, and 4 minifigures.
Dimensions – In its standard configuration, the toy skatepark set measures over 7.5 in. (19 cm) high, 17.5
in. (44 cm) wide and 10 in. (25 cm) deep.
LEGO minifigure accessories – Includes a toy bike, skateboard, in-line skates, scooter, and a cell phone.
The front of the box shows the skatepark underneath a highway. The skatepark is equipped with 5
different sets of ramps, railings, platforms, and even a basketball hoop for your skaters to play! One of the
skaters just flew off the ramp on his bicycle. Another is riding down a steep ramp with his rollerskates.
One just went up the ramp with their scooter and looks like they are flying! One is at the top of the ramp
about to dunk on the hoop with their skateboard in their other hand! Underneath one of the ramps, there
is a room for skaters to relax. Lastly, there is also a boombox with a phone that is playing music for the
skaters to jam to!
The back of the box shows the entire skatepark and how each ramp, stair piece, platform, and railing, are
all removable. You can change the skatepark to how you like! The next picture shows an alternate build
for the skatepark that changes the position of all the pieces. The big picture on the bottom shows a skater
on his roller-skates going down a huge ramp. Underneath him, there are 2 other skaters relaxing, drinking
soda, and jamming to music. The last skater is on his bicycle ready to ride across the railing. Hope he can
keep his balance! The back of the box also has 3 smaller pictures of the skaters showing them doing
tricks on the ramps and railings.
The top of the box shows all 4 skaters having a good time drinking soda, jamming to music, and dancing.
The build is 454 pieces in total, 169 pages/steps long, and is for ages 6+.

Welcome to text-based instructions from LEGO for the Blind. Before you start building, here are some
terms we may be using:
- Front: towards you.
- Back: away from you.
- Up: towards the ceiling.
- Down: towards the floor.
- Stud: the bump on a Lego brick. Example: A 2x1 brick has 2 studs on it.
- Gap: part lower than the surrounding area.
- Vertically: going from front to behind.
- Horizontally: going from left to right.
- Upright: pointing up towards the ceiling.
- Symmetrically: a mirror image. Example: If you place a 2x1 brick with technic connector on the front
wall at the right, connector to the front, and then place another such piece symmetrically on the back wall,
at the right, the technic connector of the second piece should point to the back, since it will be placed
symmetrically.
- Centered vertically: even amount of space in front of and back of the piece
- Centered horizontally: even amount of space left and right of the piece.

For builders with low vision, or a sighted building partner may want to follow along with the printed visual
instructions that come with each kit, or PDF versions are always online at LEGO.com for each set:
(https://www.lego.com/en-us/service/buildinginstructions/60364) As low vision users may benefit from
viewing the instructions on a personal device where they can zoom in on content and use assistive
technologies to enhance the visuals.
§
Sorting the pieces:
To begin a successful build, it helps to sort the pieces into groups, bags, or small containers. Have a
friend or family member do this in advance following the instructions below. You will see that the pieces
should be sorted according to the building steps in the kit. Doing this in advance makes locating the
pieces for each step easier. See below on how to sort the pieces to correspond to the steps in this set.
Number the containers using letters A-Z, numbers, or meaningful names. The parts will be sorted into one
or a small number of steps in the instructions. Example: Steps 1-3 means collect all the parts used in
steps 1,2 and 3, and put them in one container.
This LEGO set comes with 5 bags labeled 1 through 5, 3 sets of instructions, a sticker sheet, and an
unlabeled bag with big/unique pieces. There are 5 instructions to place a sticker on page 57 of book 1,
and then 28, 42, 50, and 61 of book 2 If you want to use the sticker for the build, it should be put on as
you or your helper sort the pieces! Sort the pieces into groups or piles as described below. Note that
where there are multiple colors of the same brick in a step, the colors will be split into 2 groups to make
telling the difference easier for the builder! Lego includes a few spare parts in case you lose something.
Set these into their own group away from the rest, in case you need them later.

a handlebars piece into the bottom side of the smooth plate.
34. Locate 1 dark grey 4x8 ramp with a 1x4 part that overhangs. Vertically place the part that overhangs
into the right stud gap.
35. Bring back your main build now. Ensure that it is still horizontal to you with the ramp part facing back.
Then using the overhang of the 2x4 tile on the left side, attach it to your previous build in the front 1x4 gap
that is to the left.
36. Put your main build aside for now because it is time to make a platform for your skaters! Locate 1
dark tan 2x4 plate and 1 light tan 4x4 plate. Place the 4x4 plate on top of the horizontal 2x4 plate so that
there is a 1x4 overhang in the front and back.
37. Locate 2 teal 4x6 slope pieces. Place the right side of the build you just made in step 36 into the gap
of the 4x6 slope. Then insert the left side of this build into the gap of the 4x6 slope.

and right. Locate 2 white 1x1 plates and 1 black 1x2 brick. Symmetrically place the white 1x1 plates in the
back left and back right corners of the build. Then between these 1x1 plates, horizontally place your 1x2
brick.
Group 4 — Platform
39. Locate 3 teal 1x4 tiles and 2 light green 1x2 slopes with a 1x1 overhang. Horizontally place the 1x4
tiles, 1 in front of the other, in front of the previously placed pieces from the last step. Then symmetrically
and horizontally place the flat overhang part of the slopes on top of the black 1x2 brick so that the angled
parts overhang and snap into place with the white 1x1 plates. The slope on the left should go down from
right to left, and the 1 on the right should go down from left to right.
40. Bring back your main build now. Ensure that it is facing the correct way by making sure that the
structure is horizontal and that the 8x16 smooth plate is in the front. Then in your hand, make the subbuild vertical so that the slopes you just placed in step 39 are on the left. Then place the middle of the
bottom onto the 2x2 light green plate located in the middle of the 8x16 smooth plate.
40.1 You can test that the platform is in the right place by lifting the entire 8x16 smooth plate up so the
2x4 dark grey tile at the back snaps off. Keep the 8x16 smooth plate in front of you, then take the 2x4 tile
in hand and vertically place it behind the slope of the platform you made. Ensure that the back of this tile
aligns with the back of the 8x16 smooth plate. Also, make sure there's a 1x1 area free to the left and right
of the slope. After you checked that it is correct, you can put the build back together by horizontally 
placing the 2x4 tile to the back gap of the smooth plate. Then place the overhang part back into the main
build in the same front gap to the left.

on the left. Now locate 3 dark grey 2x4 tiles. Horizontally place them all, 1 in front of the other starting
from the back right. Make sure there is no overhang.
Note that you will have an extra dark grey 2x2 triangular tile. Save this piece for later.
Group 25 — Ramp Platform
26. Locate 1 dark grey 2x4 tile. Horizontally place your 2x4 tile in the front left of the 8x8 plate. Make sure
there is no overhang. Locate 1 dark grey 2x2 tile. Place this in the front right of the 8x8 plate. Now locate
1 light grey 2x2 triangular tile. This is the piece in your current group, not from group 24! Orient it so the
right corner is in the front right. Then place it in the front right of the 2x2 gap on the 8x8 plate. Now grab
the dark grey 2x2 triangular tile from group 24. With the right angle facing the back left, place it in the
triangular gap to the left of the previously placed tile.
27. Bring back your previous build now with the grind pipe. Orient it so the pegs on the side of the build
are facing left. Then with your build that you just made, orient it so the tall part of the ramp is on the left.
Then place it on top of the left side of the platform. Make sure the sides align with the rest of the build.
28. Bring back your main build now and orient it so that the ramp above the room is horizontal and that
the basketball hoop is on the right. Rotate your platform build with the grind pipe and ramp 180 degrees
so that the pegs are facing right. Then insert the pegs into the holes on the left side of the main build
under the ramp. Make sure it is flat on the surface.
29. Locate your large ramp build and orient it so the pegs are facing right. Then insert it into the pegs on
the left side of the platform with the grind pipe and ramp. Locate your build with the staircase and orient it
so the pegs are facing back. Then insert the pegs into the right holes located on the front of the platform
with the grind pipe and ramp. Now locate your build with the steep ramp and boombox. Orient it so the
pegs are facing back. Then insert the pegs into the holes on the front of the platform and to the left of the
staircase build. 
Congratulations, you finished the skate park! Now grab your skaters and let them ride on the ramps and
