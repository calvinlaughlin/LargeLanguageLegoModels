§
Welcome to text-based instructions from LEGO for the Blind. Before you start building, here are some
terms we’ll be using:
Front: towards you.
Back: away from you.
Up: towards the ceiling.
Down: towards the floor.
Stud: the bump on a Lego brick. Example: A 2x1 brick has two studs on it.
Vertically: going from front to back.
Horizontally: going from left to right.
Upright: pointing up towards the ceiling, and down towards the floor.
Symmetrically: a mirror image. Example: If you place a 2x1 brick with technic connector on the
front wall at the right, connector to the front, and then place another such piece symmetrically on
the back wall, at the right, the technic connector of the second piece should point to the back,
since it will be placed symmetrically.
There are also abbreviations defined at the end of this file.

Motorization Instructions: Please note, the Power Functions
Train Motor, High-speed IR Remote, IR Receiver and Battery Box
are sold separately. (Also note: I do not have these parts, so am
estimating as to how they should go.) Remove the Dummy engine
and replace it with the real engine, (train motor.) Put the IR
receiver to the back, under the ski pieces. Run the cable under
the car, to the second car. Put the Battery box in the second
car. You could also connect two of this set to make an entire train.
On the back is an ad for Lego Town Hall, (set 10224.)
Thank you so much for building this set!
