10197 Fire Brigade
§
Welcome to text-based instructions from LEGO for the Blind. Before you start building, here are some
terms we’ll be using:
Front: towards you.
Back: away from you.
Up: towards the ceiling.
Down: towards the floor.
Stud: the bump on a Lego brick. Example: A 2x1 brick has two studs on it.
Vertically: going from front to back.
Horizontally: going from left to right.
Upright: pointing up towards the ceiling, and down towards the floor.
Symmetrically: a mirror image. Example: If you place a 2x1 brick with technic connector on the
front wall at the right, connector to the front, and then place another such piece symmetrically on
the back wall, at the right, the technic connector of the second piece should point to the back,
since it will be placed symmetrically.
There are also abbreviations defined at the end of this file.
The fire brigade drives to the scene from this detailed and realistic 1930’s fire station. Designed to fit with
other modular buildings like 10211 Grand Emporium and 10185 Green Grocer, the station features rare
LEGO® pieces and innovative construction techniques. It includes a ‘30s-style fire truck, 4 minifigures, a
fire dog, an opening station garage door, and a removable building roof for interior access. It also
includes 2 fully furnished floors with fire-fighting tools, racks for the firemen's helmets, fire-pole, ping-pong
table, kitchen with fully stocked fridge, couch, bookshelf and a roof with a water tower and bell.
