The Tranquil Garden comes in a box which is solid black, with a gold band around the bottom. The gold
band is patterned with various LEGO elements.
The front of the box shows a miniature version of a zen garden. The garden itself is set in a low, black,
rectangular base. The zen garden has a small stream flowing between two shores, one rocky and slightly
elevated, the other low and flat. A small house with a deck stands on the rocky shore. It has a brown
frame and dark brown roof, suggesting wooden construction. Its walls are made of white panels,
resembling Japanese shoji style walls. An arched red bridge crosses the stream. A variety of trees grow
in the garden, including conifers, bamboo, and deciduous trees with pink and purple blossoms. Purple
lotus flowers grow in the stream. A multi-tiered gray shrine stands in the trees on the low side of the
stream.
The top of the box has a life sized image of a lantern element, as well as a top down view of the entire
garden.
The back of the box has a main view, three inset views, and a side dimensional view. The main image is
of the opposite side of the zen garden. In this view, we can see the other side of the building. A curving
staircase leads up to the deck and into the open door of the building, where a green tea pot is in view.
The trees and shrine have been rearranged. This set allows you to move around the accessories so you
can decorate it as you like! The first image shows the walls and roof of the building being removed to
reveal a table with a tea set on a table. The second inset shows the shrine and a tree being removed from
the garden and having their places swapped, highlighting the customizability of this set. The third inset
image shows all of the accessories which can be removed, which includes two trees with pink and purple
flowers, a conifer, a bamboo tree, a gray shrine, and short, gnarled tree.
The build is 1363 pieces, and 181 building steps.
§
Welcome to text-based instructions from Bricks for the Blind. Before you start building,
here are some terms we’ll be using:
- In Front of/Front: towards you.
- Behind/Back: away from you.
- Up: towards the ceiling.
- Down: towards the floor.
- Stud: the bump on a LEGO brick. Example: A 2x1 brick has two studs on it.
- Vertically: going from front to behind.
- Horizontally: going from left to right.
- Upright: pointing up towards the ceiling.
- That one/ppp: previously placed piece.
- Plate: piece with studs.
- Tile: smooth piece without studs (unless otherwise specified)
- A jumper plate is a 1x2 plate with a single stud on top, or a 1x3 plate with only two studs on top.
- “Anti-stud” is a term for the portion of a LEGO piece which accepts studs, like the bottom of a plate or
brick.
- Symmetrically: a mirror image. Example: If you place a 2x1 brick with technic connector on the front wall
at the right, connector to the front, and then place another such piece symmetrically on the back wall, at
the right, the technic connector of the second piece should point to the back, since it will be placed
symmetrically.
- Centered-vertically: even amount of space in front of and behind piece
- Centered-horizontally: even amount of space left and right of piece.
- Row: studs lined up horizontally (left to right/side to side).
- Column: studs lined up upright or vertically (top to bottom/back to front).

Sorting the pieces:
To begin a successful build, it helps to sort the pieces into groups, bags or small containers. Have a
friend or family member do this in advance following the instructions below. You will see that the pieces
should be sorted according to the building steps in the kit. Doing this in advance makes locating the
pieces for each step easier. See below on how to sort the pieces to correspond to the steps in this set.
Number the containers using letters A-Z, numbers or meaningful names. The parts will be sorted into one
or a small number of steps in the instructions. Example: Steps 1-3 means collect all the parts used in
steps 1, 2 and 3, and put them in one container.
This LEGO set comes with bags labeled 1-11, an unlabeled bag with large pieces, a brick separator, and
an instruction booklet. Sort the pieces into groups as described below. Note that where there are multiple
colors of the same brick in a step, the colors will be split across two groups to make telling the difference
easier for the builder! LEGO includes a few spare parts in case you lose something. Set these into their
own group away from the rest, in case you need them later.

Building Instructions:
Main build 1 - Tea-ceremony room
Open bag 1.
Open group 1.
1.1. We’ll start the set by building the tea-ceremony room. First, place a dark tan 4x12 plate, horizontally
long in front of you.
1.2. Place a dark tan 1x2 jumper plate, horizontally long, on the right two studs on the back row of the
previous piece. A jumper plate is a 1x2 plate with a single stud on top, or a 1x3 plate with only two studs
on top.
2.1. Place a dark tan 2x2 tile with one stud in front of the previous piece.
2.2. Place a dark tan 1x2 jumper plate, horizontally long, in front of the previous piece.
3. Place a tan 1x8 tile, vertically long and centered vertically, to the left of the previous three pieces. It
should overhang two studs to the front and back.
4. Place a dark tan 4x12 plate, horizontally long, on the front two anti-stud of the previous piece so its
right edge is even with the already placed 4x12 plate. “Anti-stud” is a term for the portion of a LEGO piece
which accepts studs, like the bottom of a plate. Place another on the back side.
5. Place a tan 1x8 tile, vertically long and centered vertically, to the left of the one from step 3. Place three
more, in the same orientation, to the left of the first. There should be a total of five 1x8 tiles in a row.
These are the floor planks for the tea room.
6.1. Place a dark tan 2x2 tile with one stud on the right corner of the tea room. Place another behind the
first. Place a third to the left of the first. Repeat these three pieces symmetrically on the back side.
6.2. Place a dark tan 1x2 jumper plate, vertically long, to the left of the front left piece from the previous
step. Place another to the left of the back left piece from the previous step.
7.1. Place a dark tan 2x2 tile with one stud, to the left of the front piece from the previous step. Place
another to the left of the back piece from the previous step.
7.2. Place a tan 1x4 tile with two studs, vertically long and centered vertically, on the leftmost column.
Place another to the right of the first. These two pieces will mark the entryway to the tea room.
7.3. Place a tan 1x8 tile, vertically long and centered vertically, to the right of the previous piece. Place
another to the right of the first.
7.4. Place a tan 1x4 tile with two studs, vertically long, to the right of the previous piece so its front edge is
even with the front edge of the previous piece. Place another, in the same orientation, behind the first.
8.1. Place a dark tan 1x2 jumper plate, vertically long, in front of the front piece from the previous step.
Place another behind the back piece from the previous step.
8.2. Place a dark tan 2x2 tile with a stud to the left of the front piece from the previous step. Place another
to the left of the first. Place a third behind the second. Repeat these three pieces symmetrically on the
back side.
Open group 2.
9.1. Now, we’ll place a pair of slippers by the doorway. Place a white 1x1 tile with one rounded edge, with
the rounded edge at the front, on the front left stud on the entryway. This will be the third stud from the
front edge of the tea room. Place another “slipper” to the right of the first. You can put these at a slight
angle so they look more natural.
9.2. Next, we’ll build a decorative railing that goes around the tea room. Stack two dark orange 1x1 bricks
together. Make seven stacks like this. Place one stack on each of the four corners of the room. Place one
centered horizontally on the front and back rows, and the last one centered vertically on the right column
of the tea room. There should be two studs between each pair of stacks, except those on the leftmost
column.
10.1. Place a black 1x2x2 window frame, vertically long, behind the front left stack from the previous step.
Place another in front of the back left stack.
10.2. Place a black 1x4x2 ornamental fence, horizontally long, between each remaining pair of 1x1
stacks. There should be a total of six of these, two each on the front, back, and right sides.
11.1. Place a dark brown 2x2 corner tile, oriented like a braille letter H, on the front left corner of the wall.
Place another symmetrically on the front right corner. Repeat these two pieces symmetrically on the back
side of the wall.
11.2. Place a dark brown 1x1 tile on the second exposed stud from the left on the front wall. Place
another on the back wall.
11.3. Place a dark brown 1x4 tile, horizontally long, to the left of the front piece from the previous step.

exposed studs on each of the four walls.
12. Push the bar of a brown 1x1 circular tile with a bar sticking up, with the bar facing down, into each of
the exposed studs on the wall. The bar will be pushed into the hollow top of each exposed stud.
Open group 3.
13.1. Now we’ll make the table for the ceremony. Set the rest of the room aside for now. Place a brown
4x6 plate, horizontally long, in front of you.
13.2. Place a brown 1x2 jumper plate, vertically long, on the front two studs of the left column of the
previous piece. Place another on the front two studs of the right column.
14. Place a brown 2x4 tile with two studs, horizontally long, between the two pieces from the previous
step. Place another, horizontally long, on the back two rows, even with the right edge.
15.1. Now we’ll place the pot of hot water. Place a metallic gray pot in the middle of the four exposed
studs on the back left corner of the build.
15.2. Now we’ll add the hot water! Stack two transparent 1x1 circular plates together, and place this
inside the previous piece.
Open group 4.
16.1. Now we’ll build the tea scoop. Push the bar of a dark brown 1x1 circular tile with a bar sticking up,
with the bar facing down, into the front left stud. The bar will be pushed into the hollow top of the exposed
stud like we did with the fence. This is the holder for the scoop.
16.2. Place a tan 1x1 circular plate with a bar on one side, with the stud on the bottom and the bar on the
front, onto the anti-stud on top of the previous piece. This piece is the scoop itself.
16.3. Place a tan 2x4 tile with two studs, horizontally long and centered horizontally, on the front two rows
so it is even with the front of the table. This is the mat that the tea cups will be placed on.
16.4. Place a dark brown 1x1 tile with a clip on top, on the back right stud of the table. This will hold the
whisk for the matcha. The instructions show it placed at about a 45 degree angle to the horizontal when
viewed from the top, but you can pick any orientation you like!
17.1. Now we’ll build the matcha container. Place a gold 1x1 circular plate on the front right stud on the
table.
17.2. Place a black 1x1 circular tile on the previous piece. This is the lid to the matcha container.
17.3. Now place two white teacups, one on each of the studs on the mat to the left of the previous piece.
Open group 5.
18.1. Now we’ll add green tea to the cups! Place two light green 1x1 circular tiles, one into each cup from
the previous step.
18.2. Now place a tan whisk into the clip for the whisk on the top right corner of the table.
18.3. Finish the tea set by placing the teal kettle, with the handle at the front right, on the only exposed
stud on the table, which should be on the back center.
19. Now place the rest of the tea room in front of you, with the entryway at the left. Place the tea table,
vertically long with the pot at the back right, centered vertically and horizontally on the inside of the room.
There should be two tiles between the table and the left and right walls.
Open bag 2.
Open group 6.
20.1. Now we will build the walls of the tea room. Set the rest of the build aside for now. Place a dark
brown 1x4 plate, vertically long, in front of you.
20.2. Place a tan 1x6 brick, vertically long and centered vertically, on the previous piece. It should
overhang one stud to the front and one to the back.
21. Place a dark brown 2x2 corner plate, oriented like a braille letter J, on the front anti-stud of the
previous piece so it overhangs one stud to the front. Place another symmetrically on the back side,

Open group 13. There are two sets of 2x3 wedge plates that are stacked together, and two sets that are
loose. The stacked pairs are light green, and the loose ones are dark green. There are both left and right
wedge plates.
50.1. Now we’ll start making the base for the stream that flows through the garden. Place a light green
2x3 right wedge plate, with the studs on the right and the wide part at the back, in front of the 1x1 flower
plate on the back row of the base. To determine if a wedge plate is a “left” or a “right” variety, place it
horizontally long in front of you, with the studs in a row at the front. Whichever side is widest, left or right,
is the variety of wedge plate it is!
50.2. Place a light green 2x3 left wedge plate, with the studs on the right and the wide part at the front, in
front of the previous piece. Repeat the previous two pieces in front of this piece. You should now have a
column of 12 studs, and the wedge side should make a point at the front, the middle and the back.
50.3. Place a dark green 2x3 right wedge plate, with the studs on the left and the wide part at the front, to
the left of the back wedge plate from step 50.1. The two pieces should fit together and make a 3x3 with a
column of studs on the left and right, and a tile in between.

Open groups 17, 18, 19, and 20. Group 17 contains transparent blue 1x2 tiles, 1x4 tiles, and 1x1 plates.
Group 18 contains transparent 1x2 tiles with orange koi fish printed on them, group 19 contains
transparent 1x2 tiles with white koi fish printed on them, and group 20 contains light gray 1x1 circular tiles
and light gray 1x6 tiles.
Now we will start adding the transparent blue tiles and plates which make up the water of the creek.
There are koi fish in the stream! We’ll build the water one row at a time, building each row from right to
left. For the next few steps, we’ll do things a little bit differently. Because all colors are transparent blue,
we won’t tell you which color to grab! All tiles will be placed horizontally long, so we won’t describe the
orientation.
63.1. The first row, from right to left, is two 1x2 tiles, a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile. The right edges of the first
12 rows of the stream are all even.
63.2. The second row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, and a 1x1 plate.
63.3. The third row, from right to left, is a 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish print, a 1x1 plate, and
a 1x2 tile.
63.4. The fourth row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish print, a 1x1 plate,
and a 1x2 tile.
63.4. The fifth row, from right to left, is a 1x2 tile and a 1x4 tile.
63.5. The sixth row, from right to left, is a 1x4 tile and a 1x2 tile.
63.6. The seventh row is exactly like the fifth row. The eighth row is exactly like the sixth row. The ninth
row is another repeat of the fifth row.
63.7. The tenth row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile.
Now the orientations start to change. Unless otherwise stated, consider all 1x2 tiles as horizontal.
64.1. The eleventh row, from right to left, is two 1x2 tiles, a vertical 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile, and a 1x1 plate.
The vertical 1x2 tile is even with the back of the other pieces.
64.2. The twelfth row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, a vertical 1x2 tile with a koi fish pattern,
skip over the tile from the previous step, a vertical 1x2 tile and a 1x2 tile. The vertical tile is even with the
back of the other pieces.
64.3. The thirteenth row is offset one stud to the left. This row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, a vertical
1x2 tile, skip over the tile from the previous step, a vertical 1x2 tile, skip over the tile from the previous
step, and a 1x1 plate.
64.4. The fourteenth row, from right to left, is a vertical 1x2 tile, skip over the tile from the previous step, a
vertical 1x2 tile, skip over the tile from the previous step, a vertical 1x2 tile, and a 1x2 tile.
64.5. The fifteenth row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate between the right two tiles from the fourteenth row,
skip over the tile from the previous step, a vertical 1x2 tile, skip over the tile from the previous step, and a
vertical 1x2 tile.
64.6. The sixteenth row is a 1x1 plate between the left two tiles from the fifteenth row.
Let’s take a second to check out our stream so far. From right to left, the first six columns should be
unbroken columns of twelve, fifteen, fifteen, fifteen, sixteen, and sixteen. The seventh column from the
right should have a short column of three at the back and six at the front, with seven exposed studs
between. The eighth column should be a partial column with a column of two, then a single.
The stream now turns ninety degrees to the left. We’ll start making this turn by working from the twelfth
row of the stream, and working towards the front. Because the pieces aren’t nicely horizontal anymore,
we aren’t able to just move in a row from left to right.
65.1. Now we will extend the twelfth row. From right to left, a 1x1 plate, a vertical 1x2 tile, and a 1x2 tile.
Place a light gray 1x1 circular tile behind the left stud of the last piece of this row.
65.2. Extend the thirteenth row, from right to left, a 1x2 tile, skip over the tile from the previous step, and a
1x2 tile.
65.3. Extend the fourteenth row, from right to left, a 1x2 tile, skip over the flower plate, and a vertical 1x2
tile.
65.4. Extend the fifteenth row, from right to left, a 1x2 tile, and a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish pattern.
65.5. Extend the sixteenth row, from right to left, a 1x1 plate, a vertical 1x2 tile, and two 1x2 tiles.
65.6. The seventeenth row is a brand new row which starts in front of the right 1x1 from the previous row.
From right to left, it is a vertical 1x2 tile, skip over the tile from the previous step, a vertical 1x2 tile, and a
1x2 tile.
65.7. The eighteenth row, from right to left, skip over the first tile from the previous step, a 1x1 plate, skip
over the tile from the previous step, a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile.
65.8. The nineteenth row is offset two studs to the left from the previous row and, from right to left, is a
vertical 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with a white koi fish pattern, and a vertical 1x2 tile.
65.9. The twentieth row is a 1x2 tile between the two vertical tiles from the previous step.
65.10. The twenty-first row is two 1x2 tiles.
65.11. The twenty-second row, from right to left, is a 1x1 plate, and a 1x2 tile.
Now let’s take a quick look at how the stream is shaping up. The stream should now have 22 rows, and
there should be one row of exposed studs at the front of the base, and one at the back. Row 22 (at the
front of the build) should have fourteen exposed studs to the left of it. Row 21 should have thirteen
exposed studs to the left of it. Rows 12-15 and row 17 should be even with row 22. Rows 16 and rows 18-
20 should be even with row 21.
66.1. Extend the twenty-second row to the left with three 1x2 tiles.
66.2. Now, we are going to change things up and work from left to right in columns. Almost all of the tiles
in these columns will be vertically long, so use that orientation unless stated otherwise. First, place a
horizontal 1x2 tile behind the left tile from the previous piece so its left edge is even with the 1x1 flower
plate behind it. Extend this column, from front to back, with three 1x2 tiles. The right edges of this column
should all be even.
66.3. The next column to the right, from front to back, is three 1x2 tiles, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish,
and a 1x2 tile.
66.4. The next column to the right, from front to back, is a horizontal 1x2 tile, four 1x2 tiles, and a light
gray 1x1 circular tile.
66.5. The next column to the right, starting behind the horizontal tile from the previous step and going
from front to back, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, skip over the 1x1 flower plate, a horizontal 1x2 tile, a 1x1
plate, and two horizontal 1x2 tiles.
66.6. The next column to the right, from front to back, is a 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish, a
horizontal 1x2 tile, skip over the tile from the previous step, and a horizontal 1x2 tile.
66.7, Place a 1x2 tile behind the previous piece so the right edges are even. Place another behind the
first.
Hang on! We’re almost done with the stream! Now, let’s take stock of our creek again. Row 22 should
have eight exposed studs to the left of it. Row 21 should only have seven. All of the other rows should be
even with row 22. For the next few steps, we will be building columns from left to right. Again, most of the
tiles in these columns will be vertically long, so use that orientation unless stated otherwise.
67.1. The first column we’ll build is on the second column from the left on the base. From front to back,
skipping over the front stud on the base, make a column of five 1x2 tiles. The front edges of all
subsequent columns will be even with this one.
67.2. The second column, from front to back, is a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with a white koi fish, two
1x2 tiles, and a horizontally long light gray 1x6 tile which extends to the right.
67.3. The third column, from front to back, is a 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile with an orange koi fish, two 1x2 tiles,
and a light gray 1x1 circular plate.
67.4. The fourth column, from front to back, is a horizontal 1x2 tile, a 1x2 tile, a 1x1 plate, a 1x2 tile, skip
over the 1x1 flower plate, and a 1x2 tile.
67.5. The fifth column, from front to back, is four 1x2 tiles behind the tile from the previous step.
67.6. The sixth column, from front to back, is four 1x2 tiles, and a light gray 1x1 circular tile.
67.7. The last column, from front to back, is a 1x1 plate, skip over the tile and the 1x1 flower plate, and
three 1x2 tiles. There should now be one exposed row of studs to the left of the stream, and one in front
of it. The front and left edges of the stream should be unbroken lines of tiles and plates.
Open group 21.
68.1. Now we’ll build some water lilies for the stream. Place a green 2x2 dish in front of you, with the stud
on top.
68.2. Place a purple five pointed leaf on the previous piece.
68.3. Place an orange 1x1 round tile with vertical ribs onto the stud inside the petals of the previous
piece. That’s one water lily complete!
68.4. Repeat steps 68.1-68.3 three more times to make a total of four water lilies.
68.5. Now we’ll place the lilies. Starting on the back row of the stream, find the four studs which alternate
left and right, with tiles on either side of them. Place one lilly on the second stud from the back. There
should be a horizontal tile to the left and right of this lilly.
68.6. Now, feel straight in front of the previous lilly until you find another stud in the middle of the stream.
This is right where the stream starts to turn left. Place a lilly on this stud. There should be a horizontal tile
to the left and right of this lilly.
68.7. To place the next lilly, trace the left side of the vertical portion of the stream from back to front until
the stream curves, then continue a little ways until you find a stud. Place a lilly on this stud. This should
be in front of, and to the left of the previous lilly by a little bit.
68.8. The last lilly is on the front left portion of the stream. Find the two studs on the front row of the
stream. Then find the column of two studs between them. Place the last lilly on the front stud. You can
use the studs on the edge of the garden for reference. This lilly is on the sixth row from the front, and the
fifth column from the left. Now we’ve finished the stream!
Open bag 5.
Open group 22.
69.1. Now we’ll start building up the garden behind and to the left of the stream. Place a dark brown 1x16
brick, horizontally long, on the second row from the back of the base so there is one exposed stud to the
left of it.
69.2. Place a dark tan 3x3 right sloped wedge brick, with the studs on the left and the wide side at the
front, to the right of the previous piece so the back edges are even.

113.2. Place a light gray 1x1 slope tile, with the thick side at the front, on the previous piece.
114. Now we’ll install the rock. First, rotate the rock so the side anti-stud is at the bottom, and the
previous piece is at the right on the front. Place the garden back in front of you so the stream starts in the
middle of the back row and curves to the left. Find the side columns of side studs behind the stream. To
the right of the side studs is an exposed 2x2 of studs in the tiles of the stream. Place the 2x2 of anti-stud
on the rock onto these studs.
Open group 38.
115.1. Time to build another large rock! This one is made in two parts. We’ll build the left part first. Place
a light gray 3x3 right sloped wedge brick, with the studs on the back and the wide side at the left, in front
of you.
115.2. Place a light gray 2x2 angled slope brick, with the stud at the back left, on the previous piece so
the back and left edges are even.
115.3. Now rotate this assembly so the anti-stud is at the back, and the stud from the previous is on the
bottom front right corner. Attach it to the leftmost column of side-studs behind the stream. Its left edge
should touch the border of the garden base.
115.4. Now we’ll make the right side rock. Place a light gray 3x3 left sloped wedge brick, with the studs at

you.
116.5. Place a red 1x2 plate with a vertical clip on one side, with the studs down and the clip at the back,
on the back row of anti-stud on the previous piece. Place another symmetrically in front of the first. Flip
the assembly over so the tile is on top.
116.6. Repeat steps 116.4 and 116.5 three more times to make four bridge sections.
116.7. Attach the back clip of one bridge section to one of the tube assemblies, immediately to the right of
the left bar connector. Attach the other bridge sections to the right of the first. The last one should be
immediately to the left of the right bar connector.
116.7. Attach the other tube assembly onto the front clips of the bridge sections. The flat sides of the bar
connectors on each end of the tubes should be on the top and bottom. You can rotate these while they’re
still attached to the tube.
116.8. Attach a red robot arm with a clip on each side to the front tube between the middle two bridge
sections. The elbow of the arm is bent slightly, and the pointed side should point back towards the bridge
sections. Repeat this symmetrically on the back side of the bridge. These will support the bridge railing.
116.9. Now we’ll attach the bridge to the garden. Find the two clips on the left bank of the stream. These
are at the very end of the stepping stone path. Attach the bars on the left side of the bridge to the two
clips. Then, attach the other two bars on the bridge to the clips on the right side of the stream. Since the
bridge is longer than the stream, you’ll need to bend the tubes so the bridge arches over the stream!
117.1. Now we’ll make the bridge rails. Place a red 8L tube, horizontally long, in front of you.
117.2. Place a red bar connector with a bar on one end, with the bar on the left, on the left end of the
previous piece. Place another on the right. The flat sides of the bar connectors should be on the top and

118.6. The first lantern goes into the stream. Find the front left water lilly. Find the two studs in the stream
to the right of it. Place the lantern on the second one. There should be two studs behind the lantern.
118.7. Next we’ll place a lantern on the second row from the back, to the right of the back left 2x2 hole.
There should be one exposed stud between the lantern and the tile surrounding the hole.
118.8. The third lantern goes on the left stud in front of the middle 2x2 hole on the back side of the
garden. It should be in front of the tile border, on the back left stud of a 2x2 angled corner plate.
118.9. Place the third lantern so it is two studs in front of the right side of the bridge so there is one
exposed stud to the right between the lantern and a stepping stone. It should be in front of the right stud
of a 2x2 angled corner plate.
118.10. Place the last lantern on the fourth row from the front to the right of the stream. There should be
two exposed studs to the left of the lantern between it and the stream, and one exposed stud in front
between the lantern and the tiles of a stepping stone.

between it and the frog.
119.7. Place another tree on the left stud in front of the fourth stepping stone from the left of the garden to
the left of the stream. This goes on top of the left flower plate in front of this stepping stone.
119.8. Place another tree in front of the left stud of the stepping stone to the left of the bridge, so there is
one stud between the tree and the stepping stone. This tree is attached to the front left stud of a 2x2
angled corner plate.
119.9. Now we’ll place two trees in the back right corner of the garden. The first goes on the second
column from the right so there are three exposed studs behind it.
119.10. The second goes on the fourth column from the left so there are two exposed studs behind it. The
second exposed stud is partially covered by a 3x3 quarter circle plate.
119.11. Lastly, there are two in the front right corner of the garden. Place one on the third column from
the right so there is one exposed stud in front of it.
119.12. Place the last on the fifth row from the right so there are two exposed studs in front of it.
Open group 42.

120.2. Place a brown 1x1x2 tall brick on the previous piece.
120.3. Repeat steps 120.1 and 120.2 three more times until you have a total of four. These are the
supports which are in the stream.
120.4. Find the four 1x1 flower plates in the stream on the left side of the garden. The first is on the third
column from the left in front of the rocks. The second is on the sixth column from the left between a water
lily and a lantern. The third is on the eleventh column from the right behind a lantern. The last one is on
the fourteenth column from the left, to the right of a rock. Place one support on each of these 1x1 flower
plates. Angle the supports so the flat faces are all parallel with the imaginary lines between the first and
second flower plates, and the second, third, and fourth flower plates.
120.4. Now we will place the tall supports for the tea room. The tea room is placed at an angle on single
studs. The first four supports will be placed in the stream. The first support goes on the stud which is in
the stream behind the far left water lilly.
120.5. The second support goes on the first stud to the right of the front left water lilly. This is between the
water lilly and the first lantern.
120.6. Continue to the right of the second support until you find a lantern (if you did not place the lanterns
yet this will just be a stud). There should be two studs behind this lantern/stud. Place the third support on
the first one.
120.7. Continue behind the second support until you find the stud, then move right. You will find a rock.
Find the stud which is just behind and to the right of the rock. Place the last tall support on this stud.
120.5. Find the three 2x2 angled slope bricks behind the stream. The first is on the leftmost column in
front of a tree. The second is to the right of the stack of 4x4 tiles with rounded corners. The third is just to
the left of the two trees to the left of the bridge. Place a brown 1x1 brick on each of these pieces.
121. Now, rotate the garden 180 degrees so it is horizontally long and the bridge is closer to the front.
Now, we’ll attach the tea room to the support we placed. Place the tea room in front of you, with the entry
at the front right. Rotate it so it is in line with the supports from the previous two steps and attach it to
them. It should be at close to a 45 degree angle to the rest of the garden. When placed, it should
overhang the supports by half a stud on all four sides. Once the tea room is attached, carefully rotate the
supports so their flat faces are parallel to the walls of the tea room. The 4x4 tiles with rounded corners
should lead up to the entryway like a staircase.
