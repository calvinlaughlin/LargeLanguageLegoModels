Now, let's imagine that this small space shuttle is a prototype for a new line of intergalactic exploration vehicles. Astronauts will use this shuttle to travel to nearby planets and conduct research on their environments.
Here are the step-by-step instructions for building the small space shuttle:
Start by placing a white 2x4 plate on your building surface. This will serve as the base of the shuttle.
Place a black 1x2 plate with rounded ends on top of the white plate, centered horizontally and about 1/3 of the way back from the front. This will be the cockpit of the shuttle.
Place two transparent light blue 1x2 tiles on top of the black plate, one on each end. These will be the windows of the cockpit.
Place two black 1x1 round plates on top of the transparent tiles, centered vertically. These will be the controls for the cockpit.
Place two transparent blue 1x1 round plates on top of the black plates, centered horizontally. These will be the lights for the cockpit.
Place two white 1x1 plates on top of the transparent plates, centered horizontally. These will be the buttons for the lights.
Place two white 1x2 plates on top of the white plates, one on each side of the cockpit. These will be the wings of the shuttle.
Place a white 1x1 brick with handle on end on top of each wing, near the back. These will be the engines of the shuttle.
Place a white 1x1 brick with axle hole on top of each engine, centered horizontally.
Place the black 1x2 plate with clip horizontal on top of the white plate, centered horizontally and about 2/3 of the way back from the front. This will be the hatch for the cargo bay.
Place the black 1x1 brick with stud on one side on top of the black plate, centered horizontally and about 1/3 of the way back from the front. This will be the landing gear of the shuttle.
Place the transparent red 1x1 round plate on top of the black brick, centered horizontally. This will be the indicator light for the landing gear.
Place a white 1x2 tile with groove on top of the white plate, centered horizontally and about 1/2 of the way back from the front. This will be the hatch for the payload bay.
Place a white 1x3 tile on top of the white tile, centered horizontally. This will be the payload bay door.
Place a white 1x4 tile on top of the white plate, centered horizontally and about 2/3 of the way back from the front. This will be the tail of the shuttle.
Place a white 1x2 brick with 2 studs on top of the white plate, centered horizontally and about 1/3 of the way back from the front. This will be the nose of the shuttle.
Place a white 1x1 brick with 4 studs on top of the white brick, centered horizontally. This will be the antenna for the shuttle.
Place a white 1x2 jumper plate on top of the white plate, centered horizontally and about 1/2 of the way back from the front. This will be the hinge for the payload bay door.
Place a white 2x2 tile on top of the white plate, centered horizontally and about 1/2 of the way back from the front. This will be the payload bay.
Place a white 1x2 inverted tile on top of the white tile, centered horizontally. This will be the floor of the payload bay.
Congratulations, you have completed your small space shuttle! Use your imagination to create exciting missions for your astr
