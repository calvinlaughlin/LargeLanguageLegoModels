Now, let's imagine that you're building a sleek, black sports car that's powered by a medium motor and can be controlled remotely.
Step 1: Start by placing the 6x12 black plate on your building surface. This will serve as the base of your car.
Step 2: Attach the 8x16 black plate to the back of the 6x1 plate, centered horizontally and vertically.
Step 3: Build the front of the car by attaching two 2L Technic beams with pin holes to the front edge of the 6x12 plate, spaced evenly apart.
Step 4: Attach two 3L Technic beams with pin holes to the bottom of the 2L beams from the previous step, perpendicular to them. These will serve as the connectors for the front wheels.
Step 5: Attach the two small wheels to the front 3L beams using axle pins with friction ridges.
Step 6: Build the back of the car by attaching the medium motor to the back of the 8x16 plate, centered horizontally and vertically.
Step 7: Attach the battery box to the top of the 8x16 plate, behind the motor, using a 1x2 black plate with two knobs.
Step 8: Attach the remote control receiver to the top of the battery box, using a 1x2 black plate with one knob.
Step 9: Build the car's body by attaching a 2x6 black plate to the top of the 6x12 plate, centered horizontally and vertically.
Step 10: Attach a 2x8 black plate to the back of the 2x6 plate, centered horizontally and vertically.
Step 11: Attach a 2x4 black plate to the front of the 2x6 plate, centered horizontally and vertically.
Step 12: Attach a 4x6 black plate to the top of the 2x8 plate, centered horizontally and vertically.
Step 13: Attach a 6x6 black square plate to the top of the 4x6 plate, centered horizontally and vertically.
Step 14: Build the car's windows by attaching three trans-clear 1x4 plates to the sides of the car, evenly spaced apart.
Step 15: Attach a trans-clear 1x2 plate to the top of the car, centered horizontally and vertically.
Step 16: Attach a trans-clear 1x1 round plate to the front of the car, centered horizontally and vertically.
Step 17: Attach the remote control to the car using a black 1x2 plate with one knob, on the top of the car, centered horizontally and vertically.
Step 18: Attach the wires from the motor and battery box to the remote control receiver.
Step 19: Test the car to make sure it's working properly.
Step 20: Admire your sleek, black sports car and show it off to your friends and family!
