Now, let's imagine that we are building a castle for the Lord of the Rings character Gimli, the dwarf. This castle will be a small fortress for Gimli to defend against any enemies that may approach.
Step 1: Begin by placing the 6x6 dark gray plate on your building surface. This will serve as the base of the castle.
Step 2: Attach two 4x6 dark gray plates to the left and right sides of the baseplate, leaving a one-stud gap in the middle.
Step 3: Add two 2x6 dark gray plates on top of the 4x6 plates, aligned with the edges.
Step 4: Place two 1x6 dark gray bricks on top of the 2x6 plates, centered horizontally.
Step 5: Add two 1x4 dark gray bricks on top of the 1x6 bricks, also centered horizontally.
Step 6: Attach two 1x2 dark gray bricks with vertical grooves to the top of the 1x4 bricks, aligned with the edges.
Step 7: Place two 1x2 dark gray bricks with horizontal grooves on top of the previous bricks, also aligned with the edges.
Step 8: Add two 1x1 dark gray bricks with vertical grooves on top of the horizontal grooved bricks.
Step 9: Attach two 1x1 dark gray bricks with horizontal grooves on top of the vertical grooved bricks.
Step 10: Place two 1x1 dark gray round bricks on top of the horizontal grooved bricks, in the middle of each section.
Step 11: Add two 1x1 dark gray plates with vertical bars on top of the round bricks.
Step 12: Attach two 1x1 dark gray plates with horizontal bars on top of the vertical barred plates.
Step 13: Place two 1x1 dark gray slope bricks with studs on the side on top of the horizontal barred plates, aligned with the edges.
Step 14: Add two 2x2 dark gray tiles with studs on one side on top of the slope bricks, centered horizontally.
Step 15: Attach two 2x2 dark gray corner plates on top of the tiles, aligned with the edges.
Step 16: Place two 2x2 dark gray inverted slopes on top of the corner plates, aligned with the edges.
Step 17: Add two 2x2x3 dark gray wall elements on top of the inverted slopes, aligned with the edges.
Step 18: Attach two 2x2x4 dark gray wall elements on top of the wall elements, aligned with the edges.
Step 19: Place the 2x6 dark gray arch on top of the wall elements, aligned with the front edge.
Step 20: Add the 2x2 dark gray window frame on top of the arch, centered horizontally.
Congratulations, you have completed your Lord of the Rings castle! Attach the minifigure torso, helmet, and sword to bring Gimli to life and defend the castle.
