Now, let's imagine that we are building a medieval castle on a hill, overlooking a peaceful village. The castle is the home of a brave and noble knight who protects the villagers from any danger that may come their way.
Step 1: Place a 6x6 plate in Dark Bluish Gray (6177863) in front of you.
Step 2: Build the first level of the castle by placing a 2x4 plate (3022) in the middle of the 6x6 plate, followed by a 2x2 plate (3020) in front of the 2x4 plate, and a 1x2 plate (3021) to the left of the 2x2 plate.
Step 3: Add the second level of the castle by placing a 1x4 brick (3009) on top of the 2x2 plate, followed by a 2x2 brick (3003) on top of the 1x4 brick, and a 1x2 brick (3001) on top of the 2x2 brick.
Step 4: Add the third level of the castle by placing a 1x4 tile (2431) on top of the 1x2 brick, followed by a 2x2 tile (2430) on top of the 1x4 tile, and a 1x2 tile (2429) on top of the 2x2 tile.
Step 5: Add the roof of the castle by placing a 4x4x2 tower roof (30392) on top of the 1x2 tile.
Step 6: Add a door to the castle by placing a 1x4x6 door (60206) on the left side of the castle.
Step 7: Add a window to the castle by placing a 1x2x2 window (60601) on the right side of the castle.
Step 8: Add some details to the castle by placing two 1x2 jumper plates (15573) on top of the 2x4 plate, and two 1x1 round plates (98138) on top of the jumper plates.
Step 9: Add some transparency to the castle by placing two 1x1 transparent round plates (30039) on top of the 1x2 tiles.
Step 10: Add some texture to the castle by placing two 1x2 bricks with grooves (87580) on top of the 2x2 bricks.
Step 11: Add some more texture to the castle by placing a 2x2 brick with grooves (87581) on top of the 1x4 tile.
Step 12: Add some final details to the castle by placing a 1x1x2/3 brick with axle hole (6112) on top of the 2x2 tile, and a knight minifigure with helmet and shield (3626) on top of the 1x1x2/3 brick.
Step 13: Build the hill for the castle by stacking 1x2 plates with rounded corners (27262) in alternating directions to create a sloping surface. Start with a row of three plates at the back of the castle, and then add rows of two and one plate in front of it.
Step 14: Add some texture to the hill by placing 1x1 round bricks (4073) on top of the hill in a scattered pattern.
Step 15: Create a path leading up to the castle by placing 1x2 plates with handle (60190) horizontally on the hill. Place one plate at the bottom of the hill, and then add two more plates on top of it, staggered to the left and right.
Step 16: Add some greenery to the scene by placing 1x2 plates with groove (87582) on top of the hill and the path. Place one plate at the bottom of the hill, and then add two more plates on top of it, staggered to the left and right.
Step 17: Add some flowers to the scene by placing 1x1 plates with groove (87583) on top of the 1x2 plates with groove. Place one plate on each of the staggered plates.
Step 18: Add a tree to the scene by stacking 1x1 round bricks (4073) on top of each other to create a trunk. Place a 2x2 slope brick 75 degrees (26602) on top of the trunk to create the canopy.
Step 19: Add a flag to the castle by placing a 1x2 jumper plate (15573) on top of the tower roof, and then placing a 1x1 round plate (98138) on top of the jumper plate. Place a 2x2 tile (2430) on top of the round plate, and then place a 1x2 plate with clip (3035) on top of the tile. Attach a flag element (30162) to the clip.
Step 20: Congratulations! You have completed your medieval castle LEGO build. Place your knight minifigure on guard duty, and enjoy the scenic view from the top of the hill. Don't forget to add your own creative touches to the scene!
