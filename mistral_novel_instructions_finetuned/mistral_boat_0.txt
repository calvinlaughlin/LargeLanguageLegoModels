Now, let's imagine that you are a speed boat racer who wants to build a LEGO speed boat to race on a miniature lake. You want the boat to be fast, sleek, and stylish, with cool features like a radar dish and a wave pattern on the sides. Here are the step-by-step instructions to build your very own LEGO speed boat:
Start by placing a 2x8 plate on your building surface. This will form the base of the speed boat.
Place a 2x12 plate on top of the 2x8 plate, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place a 4x6 plate on top of the 2x12 plate, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place a 1x6 brick on top of the 4x6 plate, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place a 1x8 brick on top of the 1x6 brick, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place a 2x2 corner brick on the front left corner of the 1x8 brick.
Place a 2x4 corner brick on the front right corner of the 1x8 brick.
Place a 1x2 brick on top of the 2x2 corner brick, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place a 1x4 brick on top of the 2x4 corner brick, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place a 1x2 jumper plate on top of the 1x2 brick, with the stud facing forward.
Place a 1x4 jumper plate on top of the 1x4 brick, with the stud facing forward.
Place a 1x2 plate with clip vertical on top of the 1x2 jumper plate, with the clip facing forward.
Place a 1x2 plate with clip horizontal on top of the 1x4 jumper plate, with the clip facing forward.
Place a 1x1 round plate on top of the 1x2 plate with clip vertical, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place a 1x1 round brick on top of the 1x2 plate with clip horizontal, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place a 1x2 tile with groove on top of the 1x1 round plate, with the groove facing forward.
Place a 1x3 tile on top of the 1x2 tile with groove, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place a 1x2 grille tile on top of the 1x3 tile, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place a 1x2 plate with shaft no. 1 on top of the 1x2 grille tile, with the shaft facing forward.
Place a 1x2 plate with shaft no. 2 on top of the 1x2 plate with shaft no. 1, with the shaft facing forward.
Place a 2x2 round plate on top of the 1x2 plate with shaft no. 2, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place a 2x2 round tile on top of the 2x2 round plate, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place a 2x2 tile with studs on edge on top of the 2x2 round tile, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place a 2x4 tile with arch on top of the 2x2 tile with studs on edge, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place a 2x4 panel with window on top of the 2x4 tile with arch, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place a 2x6 panel with window on top of the 2x4 panel with window, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place a 2x8 panel with window on top of the 2x6 panel with window, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place a 4x4 dish on top of the 2x8 panel with window, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place a 4x4 radar dish on top of the 4x4 dish, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place two 2x2 curved slopes on either side of the radar dish, angled downwards.
Place two 2x2 inverted curved slopes on either side of the 2x2 curved slopes, angled upwards.
Place two 1x2 tiles with wave pattern on top of the 2x2 inverted curved slopes, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place a 1x2 technic brick on top of the 1x2 tile with wave pattern on the left side of the speed boat.
Place a 1x4 technic brick on top of the 1x2 tile with wave pattern on the right side of the speed boat.
Place a 1x6 technic brick on top of the 1x4 technic brick, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place a 1x2 technic plate on top of the 1x6 technic brick, with the stud facing forward.
Congratulations! You have now completed your LEGO speed boat. Use the 1x2 rubber band and the 1x3 rubber band to create a propeller at the back of the speed boat. Attach the 2x2 round tile with hole to the front of the speed boat using a technic pin to create a steering wheel. You can now race your speed boat on a miniature lake or pool and imagine yourself as a speed boat racer!
