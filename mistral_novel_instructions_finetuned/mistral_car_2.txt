Now, let's imagine our truck is a delivery truck for a bakery. The baker has asked you to build a small LEGO delivery truck to help transport their delicious pastries to customers.
Here are the step-by-step instructions for building your LEGO delivery truck:
Start by placing a 6x16 plate on your building surface. This will serve as the base of your truck.
Place two 4x2 plates on the front and back of the base plate, centered horizontally and vertically. These will form the front and back of the truck bed.
Place two 2x2 plates on top of the 4x2 plates, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place two 1x2 plates on top of the 2x2 plates, also centered horizontally and vertically.
Place two 1x1 plates on top of the 1x2 plates, again centered horizontally and vertically.
Place two 1x4 bricks on top of the 1x1 plates, centered horizontally and vertically. These will form the sides of the truck bed.
Place two 1x2 bricks on top of the 1x4 bricks, also centered horizontally and vertically.
Place two 1x1 bricks on top of the 1x2 bricks, again centered horizontally and vertically.
Place two 1x1 bricks with studs on all four sides on top of the 1x1 bricks, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place two 1x1 round plates on top of the bricks with studs on all four sides, centered horizontally and vertically.
Place two 1x2 tiles on top of the round plates, also centered horizontally and vertically.
Place two 1x1 tiles on top of the 1x2 tiles, again centered horizontally and vertically.
Place two 1x1 round tiles on top of the 1x1 tiles, also centered horizontally and vertically.
Place two 1x2 grilles on top of the round tiles, centered horizontally and vertically. These will form the front of the truck.
Place two 1x2 door frames on top of the grilles, also centered horizontally and vertically.
Place two 1x2 arches on top of the door frames, also centered horizontally and vertically.
Place two 1x1x1 roof tiles on top of the arches, also centered horizontally and vertically.
Place two 1x2 slopes with a 30 degree angle on top of the roof tiles, also centered horizontally and vertically.
Place two 1x1 slopes with a 45 degree angle on top of the 30 degree slopes, also centered horizontally and vertically.
Place two 1x1 inverted slopes with a 45 degree angle on top of the 45 degree slopes, also centered horizontally and vertically.
Finally, place two wheels on the axles and attach them to the bottom of the truck bed using two technic pins. Your LEGO delivery truck is now complete!
