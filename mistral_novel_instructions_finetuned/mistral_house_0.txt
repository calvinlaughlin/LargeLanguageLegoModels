Start by placing two green 2x4 plates (3062b01) on the table, side by side. These will form the base of the house.
Place a red 2x2 plate (3022) in the middle of the two green plates. This will be the front door of the house.
Add a grey 2x2 brick (3035) on top of the red plate. This will provide support for the walls of the house.
Place two red 1x2 plates (3031) on either side of the grey brick. These will form the bottom row of the walls.
Add two grey 1x2 bricks (3039) on top of the red plates. These will form the second row of the walls.
Place a red 1x1 plate (3020) on top of each grey brick. These will be the windows of the house.
Add a grey 1x1 brick (3023) below each window. These will provide support for the windows.
